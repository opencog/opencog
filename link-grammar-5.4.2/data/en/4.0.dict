 % TODO:
 % To-do: many verb simple past-tense forms include ({@E-} & A+) to
 % make them adjective-like. Strictly speaking, these should probably
 % copied into words.adj.1 and treated like common adjectives, right?
 %
 % Many nouns in words.n.4 are treated as "mass or count". The side
 % effect is that mass nouns are inconsistently treated as sometimes
 % singular, sometimes plural. e.g. words.n.3 gets <noun-sub-s> &
 % <noun-main-m>. This is a kind-of ugly tangle, it should really
 % be sorted out so that links are properly marked as s, p or m.
 % This is mostly fixed, except that some uses of <noun-main-m>
 % remain, below.

% Capitalization handling (null effect for now- behave as empty words).
1stCAP.zzz: ZZZ-;
nonCAP.zzz: ZZZ-;

% Null links. These are used to drop the requirement for certain words
% to appear during parsing. Basically, if a parse fails at a given cost,
% it is retried at a higher cost (by raising the disjunct_cost).
% Currently, two different nulls are defined: a no-det-null, and a
% costly null.  The no-det-null is used to make determiners optional;
% this allows for the parsing of newspaper headlines and clipped
% technical speech (e.g. medical, engineering, where determiners are
% often dropped).  The costly-null is used during panic parsing.
% Currently, both have the same cost: using a less costly null results
% in too many sentences being parsed incorrectly.  Oh well.

% Default cost=4.  This allows the Russian dicts to use a cost of 3 for
% various things, including regex matches for unknown words. (i.e. panic
% parsing is set to 4 at this time.)

% The marker-entity is used to identify identity names.
% The marker-common-entity is used to identify all common nouns
% and adjectives that might appear in entity names:
% e.g. "Great Southern Federal Bank and Railroad" or "Aluminum Bahrain"
% These markers are used by the tokenizer, to help identify entities,
% which can appear capitalized at the start of sentences.  (Actually,
% at this time, only <marker-common-entity> is used. We keep around

% Just pure singular entities, no mass nouns
% The CAPITALIZED-WORDS rule is triggered by regex matching, and
% applies to all capitalized words that are not otherwise found in
% the dictionary.
% ({[[@MX+]]} & AN+) comes from postposed modifiers:
% "Codon 311 (Cys --> Ser) polymorphism"
%
% We do NOT tag these with <marker-entity>, a this messes up first-word
% processing in tokenize.c.  So for example, we do *not* want "There"
% in "There they are" tagged as an entity, just because its capitalized.
% We really do want to force the lower-case usage, because the lower case
% is in the dict, and its the right word to use. (The only entities that
% should be tagged as such are those that are in the dicts, in thier
% capitalized form, e.g. "Sue.f" female given name as opposed to "sue.v"
% verb in the sentence "Sue went to the store.")
%
% To help discourage capitalized use when the lower-case is in the dict,
% we give a slight cost to [<noun-sub-s> & (JG- or <noun-main-s>)] to
% discourage use as a common noun, so that the lower-case version can
% play this role.  Likewise th cost on [AN+].
%
% The cost on AN+ also discourages crazy AN links to noun cognates of verbs:
% e.g.  "The Western Railroad runs through town" -- don't want AN to runs.n.
%
% MX+ & <noun-main-s>: country names: "...went to Paris, France"

% NOUNS --------------------------------------------------------
% Nouns typically take determiners (a, the). The minor flags are:
% D link: determiners: D1234
% position 1 can be s, m for singular, mass
% position 2 can be c for count, u for uncountable
% position 3 can be k,m,y for comparatives, w for questions.
% position 4 can be c for consonant, v for vowel, x for long-distance.

% NUMERICAL EXPRESSIONS
% Numeric ranges, e.g. "15 to 20". The "to" (or hyphen) acts as a
% number in a range, and the requirements should match NUMBER.
% The NIf connectors (second subscript position is "n" for number
% and "u" for unit) allow "15 to 20", "15 to 20 kDa" and
% "15 kDa to 20 kDa", but not "15 kDa to 20".
% Allowing EC+ for "two to threefold more abundant". This allows also the
% nonsense "two to three more abundant", but this is likely harmless.

% O+ is unlimited because some sentences put in long intervening
