                Parse Ranking and Word Sense Statistics
                ---------------------------------------

This directory contains code that computes a parse ranking, as well
as a word-sense probability (based on WordNet 3.0) by looking up
frequency statistics from an SQL database. The SQLite database engine
is used because it is "administration-free" for the user, and because
its license is compatbile with the current link-grammar license.

This directory also contains code for "broadening" word linkages.
See data/sql/README for more info.

This directory contains one administrative tool, "cluster-pop",
which is not built by default because users do not need this tool. 
See the Makefile.am for notes on how to build it.
