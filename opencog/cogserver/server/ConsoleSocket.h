 * interface of the cogserver: the plain text command line.
 *
 * There may be multiple instances of ConsoleSocket to support multiple
 * simultaneous clients. This is done by creating a separate thread and
 * dispatching a client socket for each client that connects to the
 * server socket.
 *
 * We provide a callback method: 'OnRequestCompleted()'. This callback
 * tells the server socket that request processing has finished (so that
 * the command prompt can be sent to the client immediately, while the
 * request itself is processed 'asynchronously'.
