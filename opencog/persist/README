            AtomSpace Serializers and Deserializers (SerDes)
                 AKA "Communications and Persistence"
             -------------------------------------------

The AtomSpace may be converted from its native, in-memory C++ object
format, into any one of a number of "flattened", non-object formats.
These formats allow atoms to be sent to and received from remote systems,
as well as to be saved and restored from disk, file, database, network.

Systems include:

file       -- file-based storage
hypertable -- experimental HyperTable support.
memcache   -- experimental/broken, uses memcached for persistence.
sql        -- works well for most uses -- with caveats

xml        -- Obsolete XML-based file storage; will be removed soon.


The hypertable, memcache and sql systems all support networked,
peer-to-peer communications between cogservers.  (Although both 
hypertable and sql are currently buggy).

Note that additional i/o methods can be found in the "visualization"
directory, which e.g. dump the entire atomspace into various graphics
formats.
