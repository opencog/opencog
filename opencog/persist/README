            AtomSpace Serializers and Deserializers (SerDes)
                 AKA "Communications and Persistence"
             -------------------------------------------

The AtomSpace may be converted from its native, in-memory C++ object
format, into any one of a number of "flattened", non-object formats.
These formats allow atoms to be sent to and received from remote systems,
as well as to be saved and restored from disk, file, database, network.

Systems include:

file       -- file-based storage.  Broken, deprecated.
