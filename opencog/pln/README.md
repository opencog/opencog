# Probabilistic Logic Networks

PLN is a novel conceptual, mathematical and computational approach to uncertain
inference. In order to carry out effective reasoning in real-world
circumstances, AI software must robustly handle uncertainty. However, previous
approaches to uncertain inference do not have the breadth of scope required to
provide an integrated treatment of the disparate forms of cognitively critical
uncertainty as they manifest themselves within the various forms of pragmatic
inference. Going beyond prior probabilistic approaches to uncertain inference,
PLN is able to encompass within uncertain logic such ideas as induction,
abduction, analogy, fuzziness and speculation, and reasoning about time and
causality.

## Implementation

The current implementation uses the [unified rule engine](https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/tree/master/opencog/rule-engine)
where PLN is one specific rule base, configured with scheme function and
scheme rules.
