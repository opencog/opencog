<p>The OpenCog Framework is a research platform to build and share artificial intelligence modules. OpenCog already includes components for procedural and declarative knowledge representation (AtomSpace), task scheduling (CogServer), AI algorithm containers (MindAgents), Scheme data import and export, connectors to instant messaging and virtual world systems, and other facilities. MindAgents and other add-ons under active development explore a wide variety of AI techniques including evolutionary program learning, probabilistic inference and reasoning, natural language processing, and others.
