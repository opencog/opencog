                    -------------------------

This file contains assorted benchmark results.  This is meant to be a
historical log: as changes to the python bindings are made, we can see how
performance changes over time. This file is a supplement to and modeled after
diary.txt which uses the C++ benchmark atomspace_bm.

Some notes:

Here are the timing differences on my machine (details below):

Bind with Python bindings:  24.19µs
Bind with scheme_eval_h and cog-bind: 120.98µs 

The overhead isn't so much the fact that you're calling from Python as it 
is just plain guile interpreter overhead, it appears. Even minor changes in
the parsing requirement has a significant measurable effect on the execution
timing. For example,

scheme_eval_h(atomspace, 'cog-new-node \'ConceptNode "1" (cog-new-stv 0.5 0.5)')

takes 137.354µs per eval, while using:

scheme_eval_h(atomspace, '\'ConceptNode "1" (cog-new-stv 0.5 0.5)')

takes 123.408µs per eval. I tried reversing the order of the tests to see if
there was something else going on and the timing stayed consistent.

The atomspace is very lightly loaded for the bind link test so this test is
measuring overhead differences mostly and spending minimal time in the
execution internals of bindlink itself. Each test starts with a clean new
atomspace and runs the test prep on this fresh atomspace.

The prep for the bind tests is:

    scheme_preload = [ "opencog/atomspace/core_types.scm",
                    "opencog/scm/utilities.scm"]


    def prep_bind(atomspace):
        __init__(atomspace)
        for scheme_file in scheme_preload:
            load_scm(atomspace, scheme_file)

        # Define several animals and something of a different type as well
        scheme_animals = \
            '''
            (InheritanceLink (ConceptNode "Frog") (ConceptNode "animal"))
            (InheritanceLink (ConceptNode "Zebra") (ConceptNode "animal"))
            (InheritanceLink (ConceptNode "Deer") (ConceptNode "animal"))
            (InheritanceLink (ConceptNode "Spaceship") (ConceptNode "machine"))
            '''
        scheme_eval_h(atomspace, scheme_animals)


    def prep_bind_python(atomspace):
        prep_bind(atomspace)

        # Define a graph search query
        bind_link_query = \
            '''
            (BindLink
                ;; The variable to be bound
                (VariableNode "$var")
                (ImplicationLink
                    ;; The pattern to be searched for
                    (InheritanceLink
                        (VariableNode "$var")
                        (ConceptNode "animal")
                    )
                    ;; The value to be returned.
                    (VariableNode "$var")
                )
            )
            '''
        return scheme_eval_h(atomspace, bind_link_query)


    def prep_bind_scheme(atomspace):
        prep_bind(atomspace)


       # Define a graph search query
        scheme_query = \
            '''
            (define find-animals
              (BindLink
                ;; The variable to be bound
                (VariableNode "$var")
                (ImplicationLink
                  ;; The pattern to be searched for
                  (InheritanceLink
                     (VariableNode "$var")
                     (ConceptNode "animal")
                  )


                  ;; The value to be returned.
                  (VariableNode "$var")
                )
              )
            )
            '''
        scheme_eval_h(atomspace, scheme_query)

The tests run loops of:

For Python bindings:

    result = bindlink(atomspace, bindlink_handle)

which does the bare minimum before passing off to the C++ bindlink function
of the same name and signature.


The Scheme tests use:

    result = scheme_eval_h(atomspace, '(cog-bind find-animals)')

In both cases, this is about the fastest way you can do a bind using the 
respective mechanisms since the BindLink node is already created and referenced
in the test setup, in the case of scheme via find-animals, and for Python the
test prep creates an atom for bindlink_handle which has been prepopulated in
the test atomspace.

In order to determine how much time was spend in the bindings themselves, I 
created a stub that had the same signature as the C++:

Handle bindlink(AtomSpace*, Handle)

and had it just return the handle that was passed in. This was done to test the
round-trip creation of Python objects to be passed to the function and the
return of Python objects that were created inside the binding Cython code.

The test reports for:

Bind stub_bindlink - Cython
  Total:          0.027s
  Ops:          100,000
  Op time:        0.272µs
  Ops/sec:    3,677,294

At this resolution there is a lot of variance in the tests, I've seen it range
from 0.175µs to 0.311µs, so the important thing to note is that the vast
majority of the time is being spent in the code for bind and very little time,
0.272µs in the above test, is spent converting from Python to C++ and back
again in the bindings. In the above test, about 1% of the time for the bindlink
is spent in the Cython bindings and 99% is spent in compiled C++ bindlink code.

Benchmarks performed on 2014 MacBook Air:
   Intel Core i5
   1.4 GHz
   256 KB L2 cache
   3 MB L3 cache
   4GB 1600 Mhz DDR3 RAM

Changing AtomTable to use std:unordered_set changes the resolution time from
UUID to AtomPtr by quite a bit, especially for large numbers of nodes.
See below.

Here are some timings using new additions to the python benchmark.py before
the change, i.e with AtomTable using std::set:

--- OpenCog Python Benchmark -  2015-03-13 20:45:36.178418 ---

Test times averaged over 10 iterations
Per-op loop adjustment: 0.013µs

-- Testing Atom Traversal --

Bare atom traversal 100K - by type
  Op time:        0.026µs
  Ops/sec:   38,474,205

Resolve handle 10K - by type
  Op time:        0.552µs
  Ops/sec:    1,811,790

Resolve handle 100K - by type
  Op time:        0.575µs
  Ops/sec:    1,739,487

Resolve handle 1M - by type
  Op time:        0.667µs
  Ops/sec:    1,498,673

The "Bare atom traversal" test is just iterating over the Handle list without
doing anything which requires a resolution. It's just a pass in Python in the
loop so it is timing iteration over a Python list. The "Resolve handle traversal" 
tests call atomspace.isValidHandle(Handle) which requires a resolve from the
UUID to the actual AtomPtr. Notice that the resolve takes 0.552µs for a 10K
atomspace, 0.575µs for 100K, and 0.667µs for a 1 million node atomspace.

Here are the timings for the std::unordered_set implementation which just
substitutes:

    std::unordered_set<Handle,handle_hash> _atom_set;

and makes no other changes to the code.

Resolve handle 1M - by type
  Total:          0.312s
  Ops:        1,000,000
  Op time:        0.312µs
  Ops/sec:    3,209,804

The resolve time drops from 0.552µs to 0.470µs at 10K nodes in the atomspace, 
0.575µs to 0.334µs at 100K nodes, and 0.667µs to 0.312µs at 1M nodes. The times 
actually drop for large traversals using std::unordered_set, probably because
the processor caches are hitting for almost all the accesses and accesses for
hash table entries don't take more time as the tables get bigger, unlike binary
trees which slow down order log N. For really large atomspaces this difference
will be even greater.

FYI, the scheme numbers are dominated by entry into and exit from the
scheme interpreter; normally, scheme is 2x to 3x faster than python.
