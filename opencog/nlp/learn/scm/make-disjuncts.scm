; OVERVIEW
; --------
; After an sentence has been parsed with the MST parser, the links
; between words in the parse can be interpreted as Link Grammar links.
; There are two possible interpretations that can be given to these
; links: they are either "ANY" links, that connect between any words,
; or they are links capable of connecting ONLY those two words.
; In the later case, the link-name can be thought of as the
; concatenation of the two words it connects.
;
; In either case, once can work "backwards", and obtain the efective
; disjunct on each word, that would have lead to the given MST parse.
; The scripts in this file compute the disjunct.

; Convert an integer into a string of letters. Useful for creating
; link-names.  This prepends the letter "T" to all names, so that
; all MST link-names start with this letter.
; Example:  0 --> TA, 1 --> TB

	; Convert number to a list of letters.

; Return #t if the section is bigger than what the current postgres
; backend can store. Currently, the limit is atoms with at most 330
; atoms in the outgoing set.
;
; This typically occurs when the MST parser is fed a long string of
; punctuation, or a table of some kind, or other strings that are not
; actual sentences.
