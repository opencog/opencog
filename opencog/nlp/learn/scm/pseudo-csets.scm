; OVERVIEW
; --------
; This file provide the "matrix-object" API that allows words to be
; treated as vectors of connector-sets (vectors of disjuncts; vectors
; of Sections).  The vector representation is important, because vectors
; are the core input to a number of important machine-learning
; algorithms.  Most immediately and directly, one can take the cosine
; product between vectors (see `word-cosine.scm` for examples).
;
; This just provides the vector API, and nothing more. Other objects,
; as a part of the `(opencog matrix)` suite, do various things with the
; vector (such as compute cosines, perform other similarity measures,
; filter out unwanted/bad components, etc.)
;
; Here and below, "connector set", "connector sequence", "disjunct"
; and "Section" all mean the same thing. They are synonyms. The
; multiple names are a "historical accident".
;
; A vector can be decomposed into a sum over "basis elements", as
; follows:
;
;     v = a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + ... + a_n e_n
;
; where each a_k is a (real) number, and the e_k are the "basis
; elements".  Here, each distinct e_k corresponds to each distinct
; ConnectorSeq atom.  Each number a_k corresponds to the observational
; frequency, stored as a Value on the Section atom.  There is one
; such vector for each word, and thus, the set of all words can be
; treated as a matrix: each column of the matrix is a word-vector.
; Alternately, one can think of this as a collection of pairs, of
; the form (word, cset), and a count/frequency for each pair. The
; left side of the pair are WordNodes; the right side are ConnectorSeq's
; and the pair itself is a Section (which is why the counts are stored
; on the Section).  That is, each pair is of the form:
;
;    (Section
;       (WordNode "foobar")
;       (ConnectorSeq ... )
;
; An example connector-set, for the word "playing", illustrating
; that it can connect to the word "level" on the left, and "field"
; on the right, is shown below. (Please note that this is for
; illustrating the atomese structure, and not for illustrating actual
; English grammar; its a bad grammatical example, although the MST
; parser does find things like this.)
;
;    (Section
;       (WordNode "playing")
;       (ConnectorSeq
;          (Connector
;             (WordNode "level")
;             (LgConnDirNode "-"))
;          (Connector
;             (WordNode "field")
;             (LgConnDirNode "+"))))
;
; In dictionary short-hand, this would be written as
;
;     playing:  level- & field+;
;
; The `ConnectorSeq` part of this structure is referred to as the
; pseudo-disjunct, in that it resembles a normal link-grammar
; disjunct, but has words appearing where connectors should be.
;
; Any given word may have dozens or hundreds or thousands of these
; sections. The totality of these sections, for a given, fixed word
; form a vector.  The connector seq (the disjunct) is a basis element,
; and the raw observational count on the `Section` is the magnitude
; of the vector in that basis direction.
;
; Note that these vectors are sparse: if a particular disjunct is
; missing, then the associated count is zero.  Note that the dimension
; of the vector-space is extremely high, possibly in the
; tens-of-millions, while a "typical" English word might have a few
; thousand non-zero sections.
