; FREQ is assumed to be some simple ratio, interpreted as a
; probability: i.e. 0.0 < FREQ <= 1.0.  The frequency and it's log_2
; are stored: the log is accessed thousands of times, and so it
; is worth caching it as a pre-computed value.

; (Predicate "*-FrequencyKey-*"), with the first number being the
; frequency, which is just the atom's count value, dividing by the
; total number of times the atom has been observed.  The log liklihood
; is -log_2(frequency), and is stored as a convenience.

; and uses that as the normalization for the probability frequency
; for the individual atoms in the list. It then computes the log_2
; likelihood for each atom in the list, based on the total.
;
; As usual, the raw counts are obtained from the 'count' slot on a
; CountTruthValue, and the logli is stored as a value on the atom.
