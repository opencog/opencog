; and also disjuncts, parses and sentences.

;
; This code is part of the language-learning effort.  The project
; requires that a lot of text be observed, with the goal of deducing
; a grammar from it, using entropy and other basic probability methods.
;
; Main entry point: `(observe-text plain-text)`
;
; Call this entry point with exactly one sentence as a plain text
; string. It will be parsed, and the resulting link-grammar link usage
; counts will be updated in the atomspace. The counts are flushed to
; the SQL database so that they're not forgotten.
;
; This tracks multiple, independent counts:
; *) how many sentences have been observed.
; *) how many parses were observed.
; *) how many words have been observed (counting once-per-word-per-parse)
; *) how many word-order pairs have been observed.
; *) the distance between words in the above pairs.
; *) how many link-relationship triples have been observed.
; *) how many disjuncts have been observed.
;
; Sentences are counted by updating the count on `(SentenceNode "ANY")`.
; Parses are counted by updating the count on `(ParseNode "ANY")`.
; Words are counted by updating the count on the `WordNode` for that
; word. It is counted with multiplicity: once for each time it occurs
; in a parse.  That is, if a word appears twice in a parse, it is counted
; twice.
;
; Word-pairs show up, and are counted in four different ways. First,
; a count is made if two words appear, left-right ordered, in the same
; sentence. This count is stored in the CountTV for the EvaluationLink
; on (PredicateNode "*-Sentence Word Pair-*").  A second count is
; maintained for this same pair, but including the distance between the
; two words. This is on (SchemaNode "*-Pair Distance-*").  Since
; sentences always start with LEFT-WALL, this can be used to reconstruct
; the typical word-order in a sentence.
;
; Word-pairs are also designated by means of Link Grammar parses of a
; sentence. A Link Grammar parse creates a list of typed links between
; pairs of words in the sentence. Each such link is counted once, for
; each time that it occurs.  These counts are maintained in the CountTV
; on the EvaluationLink for the LinkGrammarRelationshipNode for that
; word-pair.  In addition, a count is maintained of the length of that
; link.
;
; For the initial stages of the language-learning project, the parses
; are produced by the "any" language parser, which produces random planar
; trees.  This creates a sampling of word-pairs that is different than
; merely having them show up in the same sentence.  That is, a covering
; of a sentence by random trees does not produce the same edge statistics
; as a clique of edges drawn between all words. This is explored further
; in the diary, in a section devoted to this topic.
;
; The Link Grammar parse also produces and reports the disjuncts that were
; used for each word. These are useful in and of themselves; they indicate
; the hubbiness (link-multiplicity) of each word. The disjunct counts are
; maintained on the LgWordCset for a given word.

; update-clique-pair-counts -- count occurrences of random word-pairs.
;
; This generates what are termed "clique pairs" throughout: these are
; all possible word-pair combinations, given a sequence of words.
; No parsing is involved; this code simply generates one word-pair
; for each and every edge in the clique of the sequence of the words.
;
; This code is problematic for multiple reasons:
; 1) The kinds of pairs it generates occur with different frequencies
;    than they would in a random planar tree parse.  In particular,
;    it generates more pairs between distant words than the planar tree
;    would. This could be ameliorated by simply not generating pairs
;    for words that are more than 6 lengths apart. Or, alternately,
;    only the statistics for closer pairs closer together than 6 could
;    be used.  Anyway, this is probably not a big deal, by itself.
;
; 2) This generates pairs tagged with the distance between the pairs.
;    (See below for the format).  This is might be interesting to
;    look at for academic reasons, but it currently puts a huge
;    impact on the size of the atomspace, and the size of the
;    database, impacting performance in a sharply negative way.
;    That's because, for every possible word-pair, chances are that
;    it will appear, sooner or later, with with every possible distance
;    from 1 to about 30. Each distance requires it's own atom to keep
;    count: thus requiring maybe 30x more atoms for word-pairs!  Ouch!
;    This is huge!
;
;    Limiting pair-counts to distances of 6 or less still blows up
;    the database size by 6x... which is still a lot.
;
;    We might be able to cut down on this by using different values
;    (on the same pair-atom) to count the different lengths, but the
;    hit is still huge.
;
; 3) On a per-sentence basis, when clique-counting is turned on, the
;    number of database updates increases by 3x-4x atom value updates.
;    If your database is on spinning disks, not SSD, this means that
;    database updates will be limited by the disk I/O subsystem, and
;    this additional traffic can slow down statistics gathering by...
;    3x or 4x.
;
; Thus, clique-counting is currently disabled. You can turn it on
; by uncommenting this routine in the main loop, below.
;
; Note that this might throw an exception...
;

;
