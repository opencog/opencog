\begin_layout Abstract
This text provides a broad sketch of how deep-learning/neural-net approaches
 are quite similar to symbolic approaches to machine learning, knowledge
 representation and AI.
 Taken from the right viewpoint, they can be seen to be two variants of
 the same structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To keep the development focused and concrete, the presentation is limited
 models of natural language, and thus compares Word2Vec, SkipGram or AdaGram-sty
le vector-space approaches to traditional symbolic linguistics approaches.
 To maintain concreteness, Link Grammar is used as a stand-in for a prototypical
 dependency grammar.
 Superficially, these systems appear to have nothing in common.
 On closer examination, it becomes evident that both employ a vector representat
ion of words-in-context.
 The context is an N-gram, skip-gram or adagram, in the neural-net case,
 and a dependency linkage disjunct in the symbolic case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The similarity becomes most apparent when the word+context is viewed as
 a bipartite graph, with words on the left side interconnected to contexts
 on the right.
 This bipartite graph can be factored into three parts, with words sorted
 into buckets of word-sense-disambiguated synonyms on the left, buckets
 of similar grammatical contexts on the right, and a tightly integrated
 central factor.
 Different approaches to factorization are explored, including low-rank
 matrix factorization algorithms, information-theoretic clustering, and,
 most importantly co-clustering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Although vector spaces are linear, semantics isn't; not really.
 Vector spaces (representing the different grammatical contexts associated
 with each word) can be stitched together into a unified whole, using concepts
 from sheaf theory.
 This completes the exposition here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Deep learning and neural nets are all the rage, today, and have displaced
 symbolic AI systems in most applications.
 It’s commonly believed that the two approaches have nothing to do with
 each other; that they’re just completely different, and that’s that.
 But this is false: there are some profound similarities; they are not only
 variants of one-another, but, in a deep way, they have commonalities that
 render them essentially identical.
 This text attempts to explain how.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The clearest starting point for seeing this seems to be natural language,
 where neural net methods have made great strides, but have not surpassed
 traditional (symbolic) linguistic theory.
 However, once this similarity is understood, it can be ported over to other
 domains, including deep-learning strongholds such as vision.
 To keep the discussion anchored, and to avoid confusing abstractions, most
 of what follows will focus on linguistics; it is up to you, the reader,
 to imagine other, more general settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The starting point for probabilistic approaches (including deep learning)
 is the Bayesian network
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WP-BayesNet"

\end_inset

: a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(x_{1},x_{2},…,x_{n})$
\end_inset

 of observing 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 events.
 For language, the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k}$
\end_inset

 are taken to be words, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the length of the sentence, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(x_{1},x_{2},…,x_{n})$
\end_inset

 is the “probability” of observing the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},x_{2},…,x_{n}$
\end_inset

 of words.
 The technical problem with this viewpoint is the explosively large space:
 if one limits oneself to a vocabulary of 10 thousand words (and many people
 don’t) and sentences of 20 words or less, that’s 
\begin_inset Formula $(10^{4})^{20}=10^{80}=2^{270}$
\end_inset

 probabilities, an absurdly large number even for Jupiter-sized computers.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the length of this text, then it really seems impossible.
 The key, of course, is to realize that almost all of these probabilities
 are effectively zero; the goal of machine learning is to find a format,
 a representation for grammar (and meaning) that effortlessly avoids that
 vast ocean of zero entries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditional linguistics has done exactly that: when one has a theory of
 syntax, one has a formulation that clearly states which sentences should
 be considered to be grammatically valid, and which ones not.
 The trick is to provide a lexis (a lookup table), and some fairly small
 number of rules that define how words can be combined; i.e.
 arranged to the left and right of one-another.
 You look up a word in the lexis (the dictionary) to find a listing of what
 other words are allowed to surround it.
 Try every possible combination of rules until you find one that works,
 where all of the words can hook up to one-another.
 For the purposes here, the easiest and the best way to visualize this is
 with Link Grammar
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WP-LinkGrammar,Sleator1991,Sleator1993"

\end_inset

, a specific kind of dependency grammar.
 All theories of grammar will constrain allowed syntax; but Link Grammar
 is useful for this comparison because it explicitly identifies words to
 the left, and words to the right.
 Each lexical entry is like a template, a fill-in-the-blanks form, a jigsaw-puzz
le piece, telling you exactly what other words are allowed to the left,
 and to the right, of the given word.
 This left-right sequence makes it directly comparable to what neural-net
 approaches, such as Word2Vec
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WP-Word2Vec,Bengio2003"

\end_inset

 or SkipGram
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mikolov2013b,Mikolov2013a"

\end_inset

 do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does Word2Vec do? Clearly, the 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{270}$
\end_inset

 probabilities in a twenty-word sentence is overwhelming; one obvious simplifica
tion is to look only at 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-grams: that is, to only look at the closest neighboring words, working
 in a window that is 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 words wide.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $N=5$
\end_inset

, this gives 
\begin_inset Formula $(10^{4})^{5}=10^{20}=2^{65}$
\end_inset

 which is still huge, but is bearable.
 When scanning actual text, almost all of these combinations won’t be observed;
 this is just an upper bound.
 In practice, a table of 5-grams fit in latter-day computer RAM.
 The statistical model is to map each 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-gram to a vector, use that vector to define a Boltzmann distribution (
\begin_inset Formula $P=\exp(\overrightarrow{v}\cdot\overrightarrow{w})/Z$
\end_inset

), and then use gradient ascent (hill-climbing) to adjust the vector coefficient
s, so as to maximize find a maximum of the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How are Word2Vec and Link Grammar similar? The above description of Link
 Grammar should have already planted the idea that each lexical entry is
 a lot like an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-gram.
 Each lexical entry tells you which words can appear to the right, and which
 words to the left of a given word.
 Its a bit less constrained than an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-gram: there’s no particular distance limitation on the dependency links.
 It can also skip over words: a lexical entry is more like a skip-gram.
 Although there is no distance limitation, lexical entries still have a
 small-
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-like behavior, not in window size, but in attachment complexity.
 Determiners have a valency
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WP-Valency"

\end_inset

 of 1; nouns a valency of 2 or 3 (a link to a verb, to an adjective, to
 a determiner); verbs a valency of 2, 3 or 4 (subject, object, etc.).
 So lexical entries are like skip-grams: the window size is effectively
 unbounded, but the size of the context remains small (
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is small).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are there other similarities? Yes, but first, a detour.
 What happened to the 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{270}$
\end_inset

 probabilities? A symbolic theory of grammar, such as Link Grammar, is saying
 that nearly all of these are zero; the only ones that are not zero are
 the ones that obey the rules of the grammar.
 Consider the verb “throw” (“Kevin threw the ball”).
 A symbolic theory of grammar effectively sates that the only non-vanishing
 probabilities are those of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{k}=\mbox{noun},\cdots,x_{m}=\mbox{throw},\cdots,x_{p}=\mbox{object},\cdots,x_{n})
\]

\end_inset

and that all the others must be zero.
 Now, since nouns make up maybe 1/2 of all words (the subject and object
 are both nouns), this constraint eliminates 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{4}\times10^{4}/(2\times2)=2^{24}$
\end_inset

 possibilities (shrinking 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{270}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{270-24}=2^{246}$
\end_inset

).
 Nothing to sneeze at, given that its just one fairly simple rule.
 But this is only one rule: there are others, which say things like “singular
 count nouns must be preceded by a determiner” (so, “the ball”).
 These constraints are multiplicative: if the determiner is missing, then
 the probability is exactly zero.
 There are only a handful of determiners, so another factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{4}=2^{13}$
\end_inset

 is vaporized.
 And so on.
 A relatively small lexis quickly collapses the set of possibilities.
 Can we make a back of the envelope estimate? A noun-constraint eliminates
 half the words (leaving 5K of 10K possibilities).
 A determiner constraint removes all but 10 possibilities.
 Many grammatical classes have only a few hundred members in them (“throw”
 is like “hit”, but is not like “smile”).
 So, realistically, each 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k}$
\end_inset

 can have only about 100 possibilities; there are only about 
\begin_inset Formula $100^{20}=10^{40}=2^{130}$
\end_inset

 grammatically valid sentences that are 20 words long, and these can be
 encoded fairly accurately with a few thousand lexical entries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In essence, a symbolic theory of grammar, and more specifically, dependency
 grammars, accomplish the holy grail of Bayesian networks: factorizing the
 Bayesian network.
 The lexical rules state that there is a node in the network, for example,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{k}=\mbox{noun},\cdots,x_{m}=\mbox{throw},\cdots,x_{p}=\mbox{object},\cdots,x_{n})
\]

\end_inset

and that the entire sentences is a product of such nodes: The probability
 of “Kevin threw the ball” is the product
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
P(x_{1}=\mbox{Kevin},x_{2}=\mbox{verb},\cdots,x_{n})\\
P(x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{k}=\mbox{noun},\cdots,x_{m}=\mbox{throw},\cdots,x_{p}=\mbox{object},\cdots,x_{n})\\
P(x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{i}=\mbox{the},\cdots,x_{p}=\mbox{noun},\cdots,x_{n})\\
P(x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{n}=\mbox{ball})
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

Stitch them all together, you’ve got a sentence, and its probability.
 (In Link Grammar, 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log P$
\end_inset

 is called the “cost”, and costs are additive, for parse ordering.) To be
 explicit: lexical entries are exactly the same thing as the factors of
 a factorized Bayesian network.
 What’s more, figuring out which of these factors come to play in analyzing
 a specific sentence is called “parsing”.
 One picks through the lookup table of possible network factors, and wires
 them up, so that there are no dangling endpoints.
 Lexical entries are look like subsets of a graph: a vertex, and some dangling
 edges hanging from the vertex.
 Pick out the right vertexes (one per word), wire them together so that
 there are no dangling unconnected edges, and viola! One has a graph: the
 graph is the Bayesian network.
 Linguists use a different name: they call it a dependency parse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Word2Vec/SkipGram model also factorizes, in much the same way! First,
 note that the above parse can be written as a product of factors of the
 form 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\mbox{word}|\mbox{context})$
\end_inset

, the product running over all of the words in the sentence.
 For a dependency grammar, the context expresses the dependency relations.
 The Word2Vec factorization is identical; the context is simpler.
 In it’s most naive form, its just a bag of the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 nearest words, ignoring the word-order.
 But the word-order is ignored for practical reasons, not theoretical ones:
 it reduces the size of the computational problem; it speeds convergence.
 Smaller values of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 mean that long-distance dependencies are hard to discover; the skipgram
 model partly overcomes this by keeping the bag small, while expanding the
 size of the window.
 If one uses the SkipGram model, with a large window size, and also keep
 track of the word-order, and restrict to low valencies, then one very nearly
 has a dependency grammar, in the style of Link Grammar.
 The only difference is that such a model does not force any explicit dependency
 constraints; rather, they are implicit, as the words must appear in the
 context.
 Compared to a normal dependency grammar, this might allow some words to
 be accidentally double-linked, when they should not have been.
 Dependency grammar constraints are sharper than merely asking for the correct
 context.
 To summarize: the notions of context are different, but there’s a clear
 path from one to the other, with several interesting midway points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next obvious difference between Link Grammar and Word2Vec/SkipGram are
 the mechanisms for obtaining the probabilities.
 But this is naive: in fact, they are much more similar than it first appears.
 In both systems, the starting point is (conceptually) a matrix, of dimension
 
\begin_inset Formula $W\times K$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 the size of the vocabulary, and 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 the size of the context.
 In general, 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is much much larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

; for Word2Vec, 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 could get as large as 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{N}$
\end_inset

 for a window size of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, although, in practice, only a tiny fraction of that is observed.
 Both Link Grammar and Word2Vec perform approximate matrix factorization
 on this matrix.
 The way the approximations are done is different.
 In the case of Word2Vec, one picks some much smaller dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, typically around 
\begin_inset Formula $M=200$
\end_inset

, or maybe twice as large; this is the number of “neurons” in the middle
 layer.
 Then, all of 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is projected down to this 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

-dimensional space (with a linear projection matrix).
 Separately, the 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

-dimensional context is also projected down.
 Given a word, let its projection be the (
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

-dimensional) vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{u}$
\end_inset

.
 Given a context, let it’s projection be the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

.
 The probability of a word-in-context is given by a Boltzmann distribution,
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}\right)/Z$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 is the dot product and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 is a scale factor (called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

partition function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WP-Partition"

\end_inset

).
 The basis elements in this 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

-dimensional space have no specific meaning; the grand-total vector space
 is rotationally invariant (only the dot product matters, and dot products
 are scalars).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary task for Word2Vec/SkipGram is to discover the two projection
 matrices.
 This can be done by gradient ascent (hill-climbing), looking to maximize
 the probability.
 The primary output of Word2Vec are the two projection matrices: one that
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $W\times M$
\end_inset

-dimensional, the other that is 
\begin_inset Formula $M\times K$
\end_inset

-dimensional.
 In general, neither of these matrices are sparse (that is, most entries
 are non-zero).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Link Grammar also performs a dimensional reduction, but not quite exactly
 by using projection matrices.
 Rather, a word can be assigned to several different word-categories (there
 are 
\emph on
de facto
\emph default
 about 2300 of these in the hand-built English dictionaries).
 Associated with each category is a list of dozens to thousands of “disjuncts”
 (dependency-grammar dependencies), which play the role analogous to “context”.
 However, there are far, far fewer disjuncts than there are contexts.
 This is because every (multi-word) context is associated with a handful
 of disjuncts, in such a way that each disjunct stands for hundreds to as
 many as millions of different contexts.
 Effectively, the lexis of Link Grammar is a sparse 
\begin_inset Formula $C\times D$
\end_inset

-dimensional matrix, with 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 grammatical categories, and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 disjuncts, and most entries in this 
\begin_inset Formula $C\times D$
\end_inset

 dimensional matrix being zero.
 (The upper bound on 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{V}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the number of link types, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is the maximum valency – about 5 or 6.
 In practice, 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is in the tens of thousands.) The act of parsing selects a single entry
 from this matrix for each word in the sentence.
 The probability associated to that word is 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(-c)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is the “cost”, the numerical value stored at this matrix entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, both systems perform a rather sharp dimensional reduction, to obtain
 a much-lower dimensional intermediate form.
 Word2Vec is explicitly linear, Link Grammar is not exactly.
 However (and this is important, but very abstract) Link Grammar can be
 described by a (non-symmetric) monoidal category.
 This category is similar to that of the so-called “pregroup grammar”, and
 is described in a number of places
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Marcus1967"

\end_inset

 (some predating both Link Grammar an pregroup grammar).
 The curious thing is that linear algebra is also described by a monoidal
 category.
 One might say that this “explains” why Word2Vec works well: it is using
 the same underlying structural framework (monoidal categories) as traditional
 symbolic linguistics.
 The precise details are too complex to sketch here, and must remain cryptic,
 for now, although they are open to those versed in category theory.
 The curious reader is encouraged to explore category-theoretic approaches
 to grammar, safe in the understanding that they provide a foundational
 understanding, no matter which detailed theory one works in.
 At the same time, the category-theoretic approach suggests how Word2Vec
 (or any other neural-net or vector-based approach to grammar) can be improved
 upon: it shows how syntax can be restored, with the result still looking
 like a funny/unusual kind of sparse neural-net.
 These are not conflicting approaches; they have far far more in common
 than meets the eye.
 A draft discussion is presented in
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Vepstas2017sheaves"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few words about word-senses and semantics are in order.
 It has been generally observed that Word2Vec seems to encode “semantics”
 in some opaque way, in that it can distinguish different word-senses, based
 on context.
 The same is true for Link Grammar: when a word is used in a specific context,
 the result of parsing selects a single disjunct.
 That disjunct can be thought of as a hyper-fine grammatical category; but
 these are strongly correlated with meaning.
 Synonyms can be discovered in similar ways in both systems: if two different
 words all share a lot of the same disjuncts, they are effectively synonymous,
 and can be used interchangeably in sentences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, given two different words in Word2Vec/SkipGram, if they both
 project down to approximately the same vector in the intermediate layer,
 they can be considered to be synonymous.
 This illustrates yet another way that Link Grammar and Word2Vec/SkipGram
 are similar: the list of all possible disjuncts associated with a word
 is also a vector, and, if two words have almost co-linear disjunct vectors,
 they are effectively synonymous.
 That is, disjunct-vectors behave almost exactly like neuron intermediate-layer
 vectors.
 They encode similar kinds of information into a vector format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is also where we have the largest, and the most important difference
 between neural net approaches, and Link Grammar.
 In the neural net approach, the intermediate neuron layer is a black box,
 completely opaque and unanalyzable, just some meaningless collection of
 floating-point numbers.
 In Link Grammar, the disjunct vector is clear, overt, and understandable:
 you can see exactly what it is encoding, because each disjunct tells you
 exactly the syntactic relationship between a word, and its neighbors.
 This is the great power of symbolic approaches to natural-language: they
 are human-auditable, human understandable in a way that neural nets are
 not.
 (Currently; I think that what this essay describes is an effective sketch
 for a technique for prying open the lid of the black box of neural nets.
 But that’s for a different day.)

Not immediately obvious from this abbreviated sketch is that the Link Grammar
 formulation of a dependency grammar is sufficiently strong to encode long-range
 coordination or enforce the correct usage of set phrases/phrasemes with

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in them.
 It can.
 There is a set of effects that can be encoded in this way, from phonetic
 structure to to morphology.
 The referenced sources open the doors to understanding how this can be

\begin_layout Standard
Each lexical entry is a word-disjunct pair; they are of the general form
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\ttfamily}"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	word: A- & B+ & C+ & ...;
\end_layout

\end_inset

Because every link connects a pair of words, it can be thought of as the
 set of all possible word-pairs allowed by that connector.
 Thus, in the example above, the link 
\family typewriter
O
\family default
 is effectively equivalent to the singleton set 
\family typewriter
{threw-ball}.

\family default
 The above dictionary is so simple, that there are no other word-pairs in
 this set; in general, this is not the case.
 Thus, the capital-letter link types are actual types, in the type-theoretic
 sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, it is notationally convenient to replace each type by the
 set, like so:
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\ttfamily}"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	ball:  {the-ball}- & {threw-ball}-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Each lexical entry above redundantly repeats one of the words in each word-pair.

This is encoding represents the exact same dictionary as the first one,
 but now using the attachment-words as connectors, instead of single letters.
 The resulting sentence parse is exactly the same as before.
 The link types appear to be lost; these can be partly restored, as long
 as some other location records that 
\family typewriter
{threw-ball}

 should be replaced by the link 
\family typewriter

\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above representation for the dictionary is verbose, and is not very
 practical for hand-crafted dictionaries.
 Link types really are much more convenient.
 However, the above representation helps make it brutally clear that disjuncts
 effectively resemble adaptive N-gram word-contexts.
 The pseudo-disjunct, where the connector types are replaced by instances
 of individual words, can be used as a word-in-context.
 For example, a quick glance at the pseudo-disjunct
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\ttfamily}"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	ran: girl- & home+;
\end_layout

\end_inset

makes it clear that it might be observed in a sentence such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the girl ran home
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Neither the subject nor the object are explicitly labeled; however, one
 can maintain statistical observation counts using this method.
 It provides a direct bridge from dependency grammars to corpus linguistics.
 The vectorial representation arises naturally when accumulating observation
 counts of different disjuncts.
 A word-vector is then simply a count of all the different observed pseudo-disju
ncts.
 For example, one might observe the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{\mbox{ran}}$
\end_inset

, which may be represented as
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\ttfamily}"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	ran: 3(girl- & home+) + 2(girl- & away+);
\end_layout

\end_inset

This will naturally arise if the sentence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the girl ran home
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was observed three times, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the girl ran away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was observed twice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this point on, the standard panoply of vector-based techniques become
 available.
 Normalizing vectors to be of unit-length implies that the frequency-counts
 can be re-interpreted as frequency-probabilities.
 Once in possession of vectors, the standard tricks of vectorially-based
 semantic similarity apply.
 For example, a different vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{\mbox{walked}}$
\end_inset

 represented as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\ttfamily}"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	walked: 2(girl- & home+) + 3(girl- & away+);
\end_layout

\end_inset

suggests that the cosine-product 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\left(\vec{v}_{\mbox{ran}},\vec{v}_{\mbox{walked}}\right)$
\end_inset

 between the two might be used to judge word-similarity: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ran
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

walked
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be used in syntactically similar ways.
 Syntactic similarity is generally associated with semantic similarity (synonymy
).
 Later in this text, it is strongly argued that cosine-products are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 the correct way to measure similarity (synonymy), and that the information-theo
retic Kullback-Leibler divergence is much more appropriate.
 A precise formulation will be given then.
 For now, it is enough to note that the availability of a vector means that
 all usual vector tricks can be applied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, unlike (adaptive) N-gram techniques, the disjunct approach also
 enables a very different kind of vector to be defined.
 Given the above corpus of five sentences, one can formulate a different
 vector, for the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

home
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as follows.
 Unlike the earlier examples, the representation is a bit more awkward:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\ttfamily}"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	3(ran: girl- & home+) + 2(walked: girl- & home+)
\end_layout

\end_inset

Note that the counts, here, of 3 and 2, are identical to the counts above:
 all of these counts are derived from the same observational dataset.
 What differs is the choice of the attachment-point for which the vector
 is to be formed.
 The attachment-point or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

germ
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be high-lighted by replacing it with a star:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\ttfamily}"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	3(ran: girl- & *+) + 2(walked: girl- & *+)
\end_layout

\end_inset

This is a fundamentally different kind of vector than the earlier examples.
 The ordinary (adaptive) N-gram vectors do not have this kind of representationa
l ability; they all collapse down to the same representation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This difference turns out to be important, and has deep repercussions.
 A quick sketch can be given.
 These two different vector types can be distinguished by employing superscripts
 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

: 
\emph on
viz
\emph default
.
 write 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{\mbox{ran}}^{D}$
\end_inset

 for the disjunct-based vector, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{\mbox{home}}^{C}$
\end_inset

 for the connector-based vector.
 Given any word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, there will in general always be vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{w}^{D}$
\end_inset

 and also 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{w}^{C}$
\end_inset

.
 Even more: there will be several forms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{w}^{C}$
\end_inset

, with the word occupying different slots in the disjunct, thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{w}^{C_{1}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{w}^{C_{2}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{w}^{C_{3}}$
\end_inset

 and so on.
 So, since the germ was located in the second slot, one should write 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{\mbox{home}}^{C_{2}}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{\mbox{home}}^{C}$
\end_inset

.

This image illustrates the general concept of a rhizome.
 It is meant only to provide a suggestive inspiration for visualizing a
 graphical sheaf.
 Lines correspond to dependency grammar link contraints between tangent
 vector spaces.
 Since any given word in a sentence can have dependency relationships to
 a number of other words, each vertex here (a word) has multiple edges attached
 to it.
 Any grammatically valid dependency parse is then a subtree of this image.
 This image is at best only suggestive; a true sheaf would have stalks,
 missing in this illustration, with stalks corresponding to the vectors
 (sections) above a point in the base space (points in the base space being
 words).

 be glued together or stitched together in a highly non-linear fashion.
 The rules for gluing are in fact identical to the gluing axioms of sheaf
 theory and algebraic topology.
 In essence, the algebra of natural language is the algebra of a sheaf.
 The disjunct vectors can be understood as a kind-of germ or stalk, similar

To simplify these last claims somewhat, they effectively say this: the correct
 conceptual model for the observational data is that of a large network
 graph, with vectors of observation counts attached to each vertex.
 When the vectors are consistently glued to one-another, so that only the
 syntactically-allowed sentences are possible, the network begins to look
 more like a bramble or rhizome, with each thread in the rhizome corresponding
 to a grammatically-correct sentence.
 The algebraic structure of this rhizome is a sheaf, explicitly in the sense
 of sheaf theory.

\begin_layout Section
Statistical Network Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The task of language learning is commonly taken to be one of estimating
 the probability of a text, consisting of a sequence of words.
 One common model assumes that the probability of the text can be approximated
 by the product of the conditional probabilities of individual words, and
 specifically, of how each word conditionally depends on all of the previous
 ones:
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bengio2003"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{P}\left(w_{1}^{T}\right)=\prod_{t=1}^{T}P\left(w_{t}\left|w_{1}^{t-1}\right.\right)
\]

\end_inset

Here, the text is presumed to consist of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

 occurring in sequential order.
 The notation 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}^{n}$
\end_inset

 is used to denote a sequence of words, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}^{n}=\left(w_{i},w_{i+1},\cdots,w_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the text as a whole is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}^{T}$
\end_inset

, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{P}\left(w_{1}^{T}\right)$
\end_inset

 is an approximate model for the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(w_{1}^{T}\right)$
\end_inset

 of observing the text (the carat over 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 serving to remind that approximations are being made; that the model is
 an approximation for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 probability.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although this statistical model is commonly taken as gospel, it is, of course,
 wrong: we know, a priori, that sentences are mentally constructed nearly
 whole before being written or spoken, and so the current word also depends
 on future words, ones that follow it in the text.
 This is the case not just at the sentence-level, but also at the level
 of the entire text, as the writer already has a theme in mind.
 To estimate the probability of a word at a given location, one must look
 at words to both the left and right of the given location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, for 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 greater than a few dozen words, the above becomes computationally intractable,
 and so instead one approximates the conditional probabilities by limiting
 the word-sequence to a sliding window of length 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 It is convenient, at this point, to also allow words on the left, as well
 as those on the right, to determine the conditional probability.
 Following Mikolov
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mikolov2013b"

\end_inset

, one may write the probability 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w_{t}\left|w_{t-c},\cdots w_{t-1},w_{t+1},\cdots w_{t+c}\right.\right)
\]

\end_inset

of observing a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

, at location 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 in the text, as being conditioned on a local context (sliding window) of
 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2c$
\end_inset

 surrounding words, to the left and right, in the text.
 The probability of the text is then modeled by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\widehat{P}\left(w_{1}^{T}\right)=\prod_{t=1}^{T}p\left(w_{t}\left|w_{t-c},\cdots w_{t-1},w_{t+1},\cdots w_{t+c}\right.\right)\label{eq:bayes-factorize}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The smaller window does make the computation more tractable.
 Here, the window is written in a manifestly symmetric fashion; in general,
 one might ponder a window with a different number of words to the left
 or right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above contains another key simplification: the total probability is
 assumed to factor into the product of single-word probabilities, and each
 single-word probability is translationally invariant; that is, the probability
 has no explicit dependence on the index 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 This is commonly taken to be a reasonable simplification, but again, it
 is, of course, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obviously
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 wrong.
 At the sentence level, in English, we commonly do not start sentences with
 verbs.
 At the text level, the words at the end of a text occur with different
 probabilities than those at the beginning; for example, in a dramatic story,
 a new character may appear mid-way, or the setting may move from indoors
 to outdoors, so that furniture-words become uncommon, while nature-words
 occur more frequently.
 The translational invariance only becomes plausible in the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

 where one is considering 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all human language
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This too, is preposterous; first, because not everything that can be said
 has been said; second, because different individuals speak differently,
 and third, because new words are invented regularly, as others become archaic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of words,
 when taken over sliding windows of different sizes, varies in a scale-free
 fashion with the window size.
 So, consider a long book, and a sliding window of width 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1000$
\end_inset

.
 The distribution of the words within that window will be Zipfian; as the
 window slides from scene to scene, the probability distribution will be
 sensitive to that scene (indoors/outdoors, with/without some character...)
 The positional non-uniformity persists at all window-sizes 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In what follows, we are primarily concerned with the grammatical structure
 of single sentences, and not the narrative structure of longer texts.
 Effectively, it is enough to work with a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 that is less than a few dozen.
 The fact that sentences typically do not start with verbs can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

explained
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by the rules of syntax; no explicit factorization for single-word probabilities
 is required.
 Thus, the translation-invariant 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bayesian network
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 factorization of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 As will be seen in later chapters, this factorization can be improved on,
 and performed much more cleanly and elegantly.

\begin_layout Subsection
N-Gram Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without any further elaboration, and taken at face value, the above defines
 what is more-or-less the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

classic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 N-gram model.
 The general property is that there is a sliding window of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 words in width, and one is using all of those words to make a prediction.
 Because of the combinatorial explosion in the size of the vocabulary, 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is usually kept small: 
\begin_inset Formula $N=3$
\end_inset

 (trigrams) or 
\begin_inset Formula $N=5$
\end_inset

.
 That is, for a vocabulary of 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 words, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{N}$
\end_inset

 probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 that must be computed (trained) and remembered.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $W=10^{4}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N=3$
\end_inset

, this requires up to 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{N}=10^{12}=2^{40}$
\end_inset

 probabilities to be maintained: even if most 3-word sequences are never
 observed, this is still clearly near the edge of what is possible with
 present-day computers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model can be made computationally tractable in various ways.
 One well-discussed variant is to blend together, in varying proportions,
 the models for 
\begin_inset Formula $N=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

.
 Such an approach is of no particular interest for the subsequent development;
 grammar happens at larger values of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, and the goal is to create effective factorizations that encompass grammar.

\begin_layout Subsection
Model Building

\emph default
 fashion, that some of these probabilities are zero, or that they are (approxima
tely) equal to one-another, or that they can be grouped or summed in some
 other ways.
 More correctly, one hypothesizes that the vast majority of the probabilities
 are either zero or fall into classes where they are equal.
 If one can find a model that captures that all but one in ten-thousand
 such probabilities are zero, then tht model becomes compuitationally tractable
 again.
 An alternate model is to hypothesize that certain linear combinations of
 the probabilities are all equal to one-another.
 The latter approach is exactly that of the neural net and deep learning
 approaches: the linear combinations of equivalent probabilities are the
 ones represented by various layers in the neural net.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a fairly rich variety of such models.
 Reviewed immediately below are two foundational models: the so-called CBOW
 model, and the SkipGram model.
 The general goal of this paper is to demonstrate that Link Grammar, and
 thus dependency grammars in general, can be understood to also fit into
 this same class of probabilistic models.
 What differs is the mechanism by which the models are trained; the Link
 Grammar training algorithm, already sketched above, is not a hill-climbing/deep
-learning technique.
 A proper comparison of training algorithms will be made after the initial
 review of the CBOW and SkipGram models.

 One then makes frequentist observations, counting how often each word is

 (The notation of the lower-case Greek letter 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$

 for projection is common-place in the mathematical literature, but uncommon
 in the machine-learning world.
 It's convenient here, as it avoids burning yet another roman letter.) The

The CBOW is a model of the conditional probability

p\left(w_{t}\left|w_{t-c},\cdots w_{t-1},w_{t+1},\cdots w_{t+c}\right.\right)
\]

\end_inset

As already mentioned, it projects each word down to a lower-dimensional
 space.
 To get the output word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

, one has to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

unproject
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 back out, which is conventionally done with a different projection matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi^{\prime}$

 To establish some notation: let 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{e}_{w}$

 1 in the

\end_inset

'th position (this is sometimes called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

one-hot
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Then one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{w}=\pi\hat{e}_{w}$
\end_inset

 is the projection of 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 – equivalently, it is the 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 For the reverse projection, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{u}_{w}=\pi^{\prime}\hat{e}_{w}$
\end_inset

.
 (Many machine-learning texts write 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{w}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{u}_{w}$
\end_inset

; we use a different letter here, instead of a prime, to help maintain distinctn

 Almost all machine-learning texts avoid putting the vector arrow over the

 as to avoid confusion in later sections.)

 By abuse of notation, one might also write, for offset

 The sum in the denominator explicitly normalizes the probability to be

\begin_layout Subsection
SkipGram
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SkipGram model is very similar to the CBOW model, and is commonly presented
 as it's opposite.
 It uses essentially the same Boltzmann distribution as CBOW, except that
 it is now looking at the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{I}\left|w_{t}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

 of the context 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 given the target word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Explicitly, the model is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p\left(w_{I}\left|w_{t}\right.\right)=\frac{\exp\,\sum_{i\in I}\vec{u}_{t}\cdot\vec{v}_{i}}{\sum_{I\in W^{N}}\exp\,\sum_{i\in I}\vec{u}_{t}\cdot\vec{v}_{i}}\label{eq:SkipGram}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, the word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

 is held fixed, and the sum ranges over all possible 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-tuples 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 in the (now much larger) space 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{N}$
\end_inset

 (as always, 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the width of the sliding window).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in the CBOW model, the projection matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$

\begin_layout Standard
The neural net model proposed by Bengio
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 is worth reviewing, as it places the CBOW and SkipGram models in context.
 It builds on the same basic mechanics, except that it now replaces the
 dot-product 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i\in I}\vec{u}_{t}\cdot\vec{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 by a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hidden
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 feed-forward (perceptron) neural layer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The perceptron consists of another projection, this time called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

weight matrix
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, and a non-linear sigmoid function 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, which is commonly taken to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\left(x\right)=\tanh x$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\left(x\right)=1/\left(1+e^{-x}\right)$
\end_inset

 or similar, according to taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input to the weight matrix is the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{I}$
\end_inset

 which is a Cartesian product of the input vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in I$
\end_inset

.
 That is,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{v}_{I}=\vec{v}_{t-c}\times\vec{v}_{t-c+1}\times\cdots\times\vec{v}_{t+c}
\]

\end_inset

where, for illustration, we've taken the same 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 as given in the previous sections.
 This vector is 
\begin_inset Formula $ND$
\end_inset

-dimensional, where, as always, 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the cardinality of 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is the dimension of the projected space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{I}$
\end_inset

 is then sent through a weight matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hidden
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 neuron layer consisting of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 neurons.
 That is, the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 has dimensions 
\begin_inset Formula $ND\times H$
\end_inset

.
 An offset vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{d}$
\end_inset

 (of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

) is used to properly center the result in the sigmoid.
 The output of the perceptron is then the 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-dimensional vector 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{s}=\sigma\left(h\vec{v}+\vec{d}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where the sigmoid is understood to act component by component; that is,
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th component 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\vec{s}\right]_{k}$
\end_inset

 of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{s}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\vec{s}\right]_{k}=\sigma\left(\left[h\vec{v}+\vec{d}\right]_{k}\right)
\]

\end_inset

This is then passed through the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

anti-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

projection matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, as before, except that here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 must be 
\begin_inset Formula $H\times W$
\end_inset

-dimensional.
 Maintaining the notation from earlier sections, the perceptron model is
 then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w_{t}\left|w_{I}\right.\right)=\frac{\exp\,\vec{u}_{t}\cdot\vec{s}}{\sum_{j\in W}\exp\,\vec{u}_{j}\cdot\vec{s}}
\]

\end_inset

Just as in the CBOW/SkipGram model, training can be accomplished by hill-climbin
g, this time by taking not only 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 as free parameters, but also 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{d}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typical choices for the dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is in the 500–1000 range, and is thus comparable to the size of 
\begin_inset Formula $ND$
\end_inset

, making the weight matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 approximately square.
 That is, the weight matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 does a minimal amount of, if any at all, dimensional reduction.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Superficially, the graphical approach of a symbolic dependency grammar,
 such as Link Grammar, seems to have no resemblance at all to the probabilistic
 approach of neural network models.
 The previous sections hinted at the presence of vectors in both systems;
 but the vectors are superficially different, and the role of probability
 in either remained less than entirely clear.
 The differences are less than they seem; different notation obscures similarity
; different traditions emphasize different aspects so strongly that even
 minor hints of similarity are lost.
 This section attempts to articulate the commonality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the neural network and the symbolic graphical approaches to language
 could be termed to two different faces of a common graphical network model
 of language.
 The structure of graph networks are a part of the standard curriculum of
 physics and statistical mechanics.
 This section begins with a reiteration that Link Grammar disjuncts resemble
 the factors of a factored Bayesian network.
 Next, the loss functions of the CBOW/SkipGram model can be seen as a manifestat
ion of standard (statistical mechanics) maximum entropy principles.
 Equiped with this insight, one can proceed along a common track in physics:
 derive the statistical models from a partition function.
 The partition function encodes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all possible knowledge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a network graph; specific factors of this graph are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Feynman diagrams
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 With the tools of physics thus deployed, a dependency parse, when obtained
 statistically, can be recognized as a kind of Feynman diagram.
 The dependency grammars of natural language are Feynman diagrams of statistical
 physics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section sets the stage for the next, which reviews several different
 approaches for obtaining the statistical information needed to correctly
 factor a graph network.

\begin_layout Subsection
Disjuncts as Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the probability
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w_{t}\left|w_{t-c},\cdots w_{t-1},w_{t+1},\cdots w_{t+c}\right.\right)
\]

\end_inset

This is meant to indicate the probability of observing the word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

, given 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 words that occur before it, and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 words that occur after it.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $c=1$

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}=\mbox{ran}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t-1}=\mbox{girl}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t+1}=\mbox{home}$
\end_inset

.
 This clearly resembles the Link Grammar disjunct 
\begin_inset listings

inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	ran: girl- & home+;
\end_layout

\end_inset

One difference is the Link Grammar disjunct notation does not provide any
 location at which to attach a probability.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Link Grammar software does provide a device, called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cost
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is an additive floating point number that represents the penalty
 of using a particular disjunct.
 It can be thought of as being the same thing as 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log p\left(w|d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The hand-crafted dictionaries provide hand-crafted estimates for this cost/log-
likelihood.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This can be remedied in a straight-forward manner: write 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 for the disjunct, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{girl- \& home+}$
\end_inset

 in this example.
 One can then define the probability
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w|d\right)=\frac{p\left(w,d\right)}{p\left(*,d\right)}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 is the probability of observing the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(*,d\right)=\sum_{w=1}^{W}p\left(w,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

is simply the sum over all words in the vocabulary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resemblance, at this point, should be obvious: the disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 plays the role of the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-gram context.
 Abusing the existing notation, one should understand that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d\approx w_{t-c},\cdots w_{t-1},w_{t+1},\cdots w_{t+c}
\]

\end_inset

The abuse of notation was partly cured by writing 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{I}$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

input
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 words of the CBOW/SkipGram models, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 was a set of relative indexes into the text.
 The disjunct notation does everything that the index notation can do: it
 specifies a fixed order of words, to the left, and to the right of the
 target (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

output
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 More precisely, the disjunct notation actively skips over some of the words
 in the context.
 Rather than specifying a fixed offset from the target word, the disjunct
 provides a relative squential ordering of the context-words, left to right,
 without specifying distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This change of notation allows the disjunct to do more than the index set
 notation: the disjunct effectively encodes syntactic information.
 How this is done was already detailed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Link-Grammar"

\end_inset

.
 With this seemingly minor change of notation, from indexes to sequential
 lists, one gains access to grammatical information.
 Do keep in mind that by working with disjunct notation, nothing is lost:
 if one wished, one could take the disjunct as being a sequence of words,
 with no gaps allowed between the words.
 If this is done, then the disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 becomes fully compatible with the index set 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 and one can legitimately write that 
\begin_inset Formula $d=w_{I}$
\end_inset

 are just two notations for saying the same thing.
 The disjunct encodes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more information
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in the information-theoretic sense of encoding 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more bits of info
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 than the index notatin can.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Skip-Grams and Syntatic Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above explicit identification of 
\begin_inset Formula $d=w_{I}$
\end_inset

 suggests that CBOW and SkipGram models already encode grammatical information,
 and that finding it is as simple as re-interpreting 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{I}$
\end_inset

 as a disjunct.
 That is, given either form 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{t}\left|w_{I}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{I}\left|w_{t}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

, simply re-interpret 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{I}$
\end_inset

 as specifying left-going and right-going connectors.
 The Link Grammar cost is nothing other than the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

loss function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $E=-\log p\left(w_{t}\left|w_{I}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

; they are one and the same thing.
 One could do this immediately, today: given a SkipGram dataset, one can
 just write an export function, and dump the contents into a Link Grammar
 dictionary.
 All that remains would be to evaluate the quality of the results.

These statements are also perhaps misleading: conventional systems really
 do use a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

bag of words
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Yet word-order is needed to write a disjunct.
 Thus, existing off-the-shelf software would have to be modified to track
 word-order, and this modification will require an order of magnitude more
 storage, possibly rendering the computation intractably large or slow.
 Keeping track of word order is theoretically interesting, but entirely
 misses the tractability issue that these models were invented to solve.

Disjuncts are intended to capture the dependency grammar description of

 A dependency grammar naturally

skips
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 over words, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

adaptively
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 sizes the context to be appropriate.
 Consider the dependency parse of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The girl, upset by the taunting, ran home in tears.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 There are four words, and two punctuation symbols separating the word

\end_inset

girl
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ran
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Dependency grammars do not have any difficulty in arranging for the attachment
 of the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

girl–ran
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, skipping over the post-nominal modifier phrase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upset by the taunting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which attaches to the noun, and not the verb: it's the girl who is upset,
 not the running.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such long-distance attachments are problematic for CBOW or Skip-Grams, in
 several ways.
 One is that the window 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 would have to be quite large to skip over the post-nominal modifier.
 Counting punctuation, one must look at least seven words to the right,
 in the above example.
 If the window is symmetric about the target word, this calls for 
\begin_inset Formula $N\ge14$
\end_inset

, which is a bit larger than currently reported results; for example, Mikolov
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mikolov2013b"

\end_inset

 reports results for 
\begin_inset Formula $N=5$
\end_inset

.
 The point here is that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w_{t}=\mbox{girl}\left|w_{t-1}=\mbox{the },w_{t+1}=\mbox{ran}\right.\right)
\]

\end_inset

can be trivially re-interpreted as the dictionary entry
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

However, that is not what is needed to parse 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	girl: the- & upset+ & ran+;
\end_layout

\end_inset

which is invisible with an 
\begin_inset Formula $N=5$
\end_inset

 The punctuation is also important for the post-nominal modifier; somewhere
 one must also find
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\ttfamily}"
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	upset: girl- & ,- & by+ & ,+;

\end_inset

which also does not fit in an

\end_inset

 window; it requires at least 
\begin_inset Formula $N=9$
\end_inset

.
 Long-distance attachments present a problem for the simpler, less sophisticated
 deep-learning models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another difficulty in a naive correspondance with index notation is that
 dependency grammars are naturally 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

adaptive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by design: verbs tend to have more attachments that nouns, which have more
 attachments than determiners or adjectives.
 That is, dependency grammars already 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

know
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that the correct size of the context for determiners and adjectives is
 one: a determiner can typically modify only one noun.
 One expects the entry

 and SkipGram 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 are sometimes called

softmax
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 functions, or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

loss functions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 From the point of view of statistical mechanics, these utility functions
 can be easily recognized as Gibbs distributions.
 This allows all of the traditional intuition and tools of statistical mechanics
 to be brought to bear on the language problem.
 Specifically, the probabilities are obtainable from a partition function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CBOW"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 are conditional probabilities, one can deduce that the joint probability
 in these models is given by 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w_{t},w_{I}\right)=\frac{\exp\,\sum_{i\in I}\vec{u}_{t}\cdot\vec{v}_{i}}{\sum_{w\in W}\sum_{I\in W^{N}}\exp\,\sum_{i\in I}\vec{u}_{w}\cdot\vec{v}_{i}}
\]

\end_inset

This can be obtained by applying variational principles to the partition
 function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z\left[J\right]=\sum_{w\in W}\sum_{I\in W^{N}}\exp\,\left(\sum_{i\in I}\vec{u}_{w}\cdot\vec{v}_{i}+J_{wI}\right)\label{eq:Partition function}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In physics literature, the 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{w_{t},I}$
\end_inset

 are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 principles can be applied.
 Doing so yields the standard Boltzmann distribution: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w_{t},w_{I}\right)=\left.\frac{\delta\ln Z\left[J\right]}{\delta J_{w_{t},I}}\right|_{J=0}
\]

\end_inset

In other words, CBOW/SkipGram fit squarely into the standard framework of
 maximum entropy principles.
 This is no accident, of course; the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

softmax
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function was used precisely because it gives the maximum entropy distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last statement can be made even more precise.
 A language model is a probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots)$
\end_inset

 defined over a sequence of words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1},w_{2},\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 The set of all such sequences is termed (in the historical literature of
 physics and thermodynamics) an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ensemble
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The entropy of a particular language model is a sum over the ensemble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S\left[p\right]=-\sum_{w_{1},w_{2},\cdots}p\left(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots\right)\log_{2}p\left(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots\right)
\]

\end_inset

The principle of maximum entropy states that the above should be solved
 to find the probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 that maximizes the entropy 
\begin_inset Formula $S\left[p\right]$
\end_inset

.
 This can be solved without the need to provide any addtional statements
 or constraints.
 Standard texts on statistical mechanics exhibit the solution; it is the
 Boltzmann distribution, namely
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p\left(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots\right)=\frac{1}{Z}\exp-E\left(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots\right)\label{eq:boltzmann}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with the partition function 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 being given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\sum_{w_{1},w_{2},\cdots}\exp-E\left(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots\right)
\]

\end_inset

To make ends meet with eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Partition function"

\end_inset

, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=Z\left[J=0\right]$
\end_inset

 so that if the current 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 is zero, one simply does not write it, as it is just a device handy for
 algebraic manipulations, but having no particularly deep significance for
 the language model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, a maximum entropy model of natural language is any model that provides
 an energy function 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

 for a sequence of words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1},w_{2},\cdots$

 Clearly, CBOW/SkipGram is such a model.
 There are others.

 The statement is effectively that vectors provide a pretty good model of
 natural language, and the vectors are able to capture important features
 of natural language, including semantics and compositionality (such as

 This is an interesting effect, because the vectors themselves seem to be
 some kind of effectively structureless black boxes; they capture some kind
 of latent structure of language, but how this is captured is entirely opaque.
 This is entirely at odds with traditional theories of syntax, as developed
 by more than half a century of linguistics research.
 How can the latent content of the feature vectors be reconciled with structural
 theories of syntax?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of the Ising model can be used to bridge this gap.
 In the original formulation of the Ising model, the loss function (the
 Hamiltonian; the energy) was written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(\sigma\right)=\sum_{i}h_{i}\sigma_{i}+\sum_{i,j}J_{ij}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}
\]

\end_inset

with the

 being the value of a

 (at lattice position 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

), and the 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{ij}$
\end_inset

 being the interaction energy between neighbors (typically, the nearest
 neighbors, and typically dependent only on the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|i-j\right|$

\begin_layout Standard
The Ising model is usually taken to be

translation invariant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shift invariant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, dependent only on relative positions between points in the lattice, rather
 than their absolute position.
 For the one-dimensional Ising model, where the lattice points are in a
 linear sequence, the shift invariance implies a number of interesting connectio
ns to Markov chains, shift sequences, and finite state machines.
 This, in turn, implies that the Ising model, or a variant thereof, occurs
 in many natural models.
 One example is the distribution of sequences of amino acids in Zebrafish
 antibodies.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mora2010"

\end_inset

 In that model, each 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be one of twenty-one different amino acids, and one is interested in
 describing the distribution of a wide variety of different sequences that
 antibodies employ to fight off infection.
 Another example is that of protein sequences, specifically, of sensor kinase
 and response regulator proteins in bacteria
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, where the goal is to identify which sensor amino-acid sequences directly
 trigger response proteins, as opposed to merely being correlated with a
 response.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point to be made here is that the Ising model also provides a natural
 way to unify the syntactic structure of language with the syntax-free vector
 models.
 The reinterpretation is that lattice position 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 corresponds to the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

\begin_inset Formula $n$

-point functions that capture the grammatical relationships between words.
 Given a sequence of lattice values 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i},\sigma_{i+1},\cdots$

 In effect, 
\begin_inset Formula

 aspect to it: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

show me something I did not already know
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 faint disguise.) What makes it not entirely trivial is the claim that the
 interaction energies (loss functions) are additive.
 That is, given a sequence of words

\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

grammatical validity
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of that sequence can be described in terms of (statistically) independent,
 single real-valued numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{w_{i},w_{i+1},\cdots}$
\end_inset

 which are additive: they are to be summed (and not combined in some other,
 more complex way).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The additive model of grammatical structure also exposes the limit of this
 language model: we do not speak in a word-salad of grammatically valid
 sentences; rather, there is always a message conveyed in an utterance.
 The statistically independent numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{w_{i},w_{i+1},\cdots}$
\end_inset

 are sufficient to capture the grammar and syntactic structure of the language,
 but not (at this level) to capture the message itself.
 The

\begin_inset Formula $J_{w_{i},w_{i+1},\cdots}$

\begin_layout Subsection
MST models of Language
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The importance of the additive aspect of the Ising model of natural language
 is best illustrated by reverting to the simpler two-point model of natural
 language, by restricting the interaction 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 to occur only between pairs of words.
 This effectively gives the Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) model of language,
 explored by Yuret
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yuret1998"

\end_inset

 and by McDonald
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McDonald2005,McDonald2006"

\end_inset

.
 Here, the relationship between words is presumed to be entirely pair-wise;
 after somehow obtaining pair-wise word statistics 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{left},w_{right}\right)$
\end_inset

, one constructs a maximum-spanning-tree parse so as to maximize the total
 entropy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of a maximum spanning tree, such as the supervised training models
 of McDonald 
\emph on
etal
\emph default
., is a key insight.
 McDonald states this in terms of a score 
\begin_inset Formula $s(x,y)$
\end_inset

 that the sentence 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is described by parse tree 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 The score is taken to be additive over word pairs:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s\left(x,y\right)=\sum_{\left(i,j\right)\in y}s\left(i,j\right)
\]

\end_inset

so that the sum ranges over all words-pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(i,j\right)$
\end_inset

 occurring in the parse-tree 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 (and the individual words 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j$
\end_inset

 being the words of sentence 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

).
 How does one obtain the score 
\begin_inset Formula $s\left(i,j\right)$
\end_inset

? McDonald 
\emph on
etal.

\emph default
 propose a supervised training algorithm, where the score is induced by
 means of a gradient descent from an
\emph on
 a priori
\emph default
 training corpus of parse trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is here that Yuret does one better: he proposes that the score be given
 by the mutual information (MI) between word-pairs; that is (aligning the
 different notation)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s\left(i,j\right)=MI\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)=\log_{2}\frac{p\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)}{p\left(w_{i},*\right)p\left(*,w_{j}\right)}
\]

\end_inset

How does this square with the Ising model? Superficially, it seems to be
 quite different: the Ising model suggests that one should have only pair-wise
 interactions 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{ij}=\log p\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 whereas the mutual information has an additional funny denominator.
 This can be reconciled by saying that there is a bulk interaction: each
 individual word-site 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 also interacts with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bulk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of all possible other words that could ever occur in some other speakable,
 grammatically correct sentence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Put differently, there are two bulk 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

magnetic fields
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or one-point interactions 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(w_{i},*\right)=-\log_{2}p\left(w_{i},*\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(*,w_{j}\right)=-\log_{2}p\left(*,w_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 that enter into the Ising model Hamiltonian, so that, for sentence 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and parse tree 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, one has a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

score
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (following McDonald) or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (following statistical physics) of
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
s\left(x,y\right) & = & \sum_{i\in x}h_{i}+\sum_{\left(i,j\right)\in y}s\left(i,j\right)\\
 & = & \sum_{i\in x}\left[h\left(w_{i},*\right)+h\left(*,w_{i}\right)\right]+\sum_{\left(i,j\right)\in y}\log_{2}p\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

When Yuret chooses to look for the spanning tree that maximizes the sum
 of the mutual information between word-pairs, what he is actually doing
 is looking for the parse tree that maximizes the entropy within the background
 context (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bulk magnetic field
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) of the language model.
 This is an absolutely key, fundamental insight of the Ising model of language:
 the relationship between words matters not so much because of the individual
 relationships, but because these relationships have to be taken with regards
 to the background of the entire language, in full.

This figure illustrates the energy functional for a particular English langauge
 sentence, chosen out of the statistical ensemble of all possible English
 language sentences.
 The arcs above the sentence show the standard unlabeled dependency parse
 of the sentence.
 It is conventional to consider such a parse as standing alone, implicitly
 with some language model that is not diagrammatically represented.
 When drawn stand-alone, the arcs are presumed to have some unspecified
 cost, such that the desired parse tree is preferentially selected.
 Here, the arcs are intended to very explicitly correspond to

 The two vacuum bubbles below the sentence, and the straight lines connecting
 each word to each vacuum are used to explicitly represent the language
 model.
 The straight lines connecting to the left vacuum are explicitly given by
 the propagator 
\begin_inset Formula $h=-\log_{2}p\left(*,w\right)$
\end_inset

 while those going to right vacuum are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $h=-\log_{2}p\left(w,*\right)$

.
 The total action (Hamiltonian, in this case) is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{total}=\sum_{arcs}h$
\end_inset

 with the sum being over all lines and arcs (with appropriate multiplicity).
 This summation makes explicit what is otherwise an implicit langauge model:
 namely, that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{total}=\sum_{arcs}h=\sum_{\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)\in tree}MI\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 That is, the total mutual information in a parse tree is exactly equivalent

vacuum

 The vacuum is an implicit context for physical processes, which on occasion
 must be made explicit in order to get correct predictions.

 Of course a language model is taken within the context of the language.

 It is considerably more accurate than the MI-based estimate.

-point Functions and Word-Sense Disambiguation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The preceeding two sections potentially sow a point of confusion: Should
 one consider a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ising model of natural language, one which omits the one-point contributions?
 Would it be more accurate than an MST-parse? Maybe.
 And maybe not.
 The author is not aware of any pure-Ising models of natural language that
 could be compared to the results of MST parsing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For natural language, most words have valancies of 3, 4 or 5, and so it
 seems that they would be better described by 3-point, 4-point or 5-point
 Ising interaction energies, as opposed to a bag of 2-point interactions.
 How true is this? Consider a transitive verb: it has a subject and an object.
 If the subject and object are truly independent of one-another, then two
 pair-wise interactions would be enough: a noun-verb link for the subject,
 and a verb-noun link for the object.
 Are subjects and objects independent of one-another? Consider the verb
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

throw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and a sentence of the form 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subject throws object
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subject
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can only be chosen from the class of animate beings, capable of throwing
 things.
 The object must be chosen from the class of physical objects that can be
 thrown.
 Although these two classes are fairly narrow, they still seem uncorrelated.
 This illusion can be broken: further restricing the class of subjects to
 humans forces the restriction of objects to the class of physical items
 weighing between a few grams and ten kilograms.
 But there is only one word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

throw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and not some hypothectical 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{throw}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{throw}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{throw}_{3}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{throw}_{2}$
\end_inset

 is used only with human subjects.
 The verb subjects and objects are correlated; when this is the case, a
 pair of two-point functions is not enough; these require a three-point
 function for an accurate description.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps, after word-sense disambiguation, one can discover multiple word
 senses, so that, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{throw}_{1}$
\end_inset

 applies to metal machines that throw heavy objects, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{throw}_{2}$
\end_inset

 pertains to human subjects, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{throw}_{3}$
\end_inset

 applies to horses.
 In this case, the three-point function might indeed factorize.
 Written as an algebraic expression, one might be able to observe the factorizat
ion
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p\left(w_{subj},\mbox{throw},w_{obj}\right)= & p\left(w_{machine},\mbox{throw}_{1}\right)p\left(\mbox{throw}_{1},w_{heavy}\right)\\
+ & p\left(w_{human},\mbox{throw}_{2}\right)p\left(\mbox{throw}_{2},w_{graspable}\right)\\
+ & p\left(w_{horse},\mbox{throw}_{3}\right)p\left(\mbox{throw}_{3},w_{rider}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

so that any kind of machine can 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{throw}_{1}$
\end_inset

 any kind of heavy object, in a statistically uncorrelated sense, whereas
 any human can 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{throw}_{2}$
\end_inset

 any object that can be grasped by hand, with there being no statistical
 correlation between the human subject and the human-thrown object.
 The third factorization is likewise: only horses or other mountable creatures
 can 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{throw}_{3}$
\end_inset

 thier riders, but there is no statistical correlation (no three-point function)
 between the thrower, and the rider.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This kind of factorization into components might even provide a plausible
 automated means of performing word-sense disambiguation, given only the
 undifferentiated, measured 3-point frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{subj},\mbox{throw},w_{obj}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Exactly how far this can be pushed, without grinding into the floor of
 statistically noisey data is unclear: only horses throw cowboys, and only
 elephants throw maharajis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Disjunct Models of Language
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although Yuret's thesis clearly demonstrates that pair-wise word interactions
 give a reasonable model of natural language, it also demonstrates that
 the model is imperfect.
 Link Grammar
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sleator1991,Sleator1993"

\end_inset

 provides a much better model of language, and it is anchored on top of
 half a century of tradition in linguistics research into structure.
 To place it within the current context, the key leap being taken is to
 replace the pair-wise word-interactions 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{ij}=-\log p\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 by disjuncts 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J_{ijk\cdots}=-\log p\left(w_{i};w_{left\,facing};w_{right\,facing}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The notation above is awkward: the idea here is that some word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 can connect to other words on the left, by means of left-pointing connectors
 (or links) and it can connect to words on the right, with right-pointing
 connectors.
 These are distinct sets, or sequences, since the word-order matters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are multiple ways of overcoming the notational awkwardness of the
 above; these are reviewed in a later section.
 In particular, the notation above differs sharply from that used in Link
 Grammar; this is a notational issue, and not a conceptual issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before proceeding, the remark of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resting on a tradition of linguistics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should be clarified.
 Link Grammar proposes a dependency-grammar like model of language.
 Other popular models of language include constituency-tree grammars, such
 as Head-Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG).
 Grammars such as Categorial Grammar (CG) combine aspects of constituency
 with aspects of dependency.
 There are others.
 In principle, each of these different grammar frameworks are convertible
 to one-another by fixed algorithms that terminate in finite time.
 That is, given a lexis in one grammar framework, there is a purely mechanical
 means of translating that lexis into the lexis required by a different
 theoretical framework.
 This perhaps over-simplifies the situation: different theories of grammar
 are often founded on subtle distinctions; for example Dick Hudson's Word
 Grammar
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hud84,Hud07"

\end_inset

 replaces the no-links-crossing constraint of dependency grammars by a notion
 of landmark transitivity.
 We sweep such details under the rug, for now, wishing to rest on the broader
 statement that all grammar frameworks can be converted into one-another,
 while acknowledging that some frameworks give better insight into language
 than others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary point here is that Link Grammar is interesting because it provides
 a bridge to both traditional, symbolic structural linguistics (per above)
 and while also allowing an interpretation as an Ising model of language.
 Following Yuret's ansatz, one includes energy terms of not only 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{ijk\cdots}$
\end_inset

 in the Hamiltonian, but also bulk terms, indicating how disjuncts interact
 in the background.
 In practice, what this means is that one should associate to each word-disjunct
 pair a mutual information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI\left(w,d\right)=\log_{2}\frac{p\left(w,d\right)}{p\left(w,*\right)p\left(*,d\right)}
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 being the joint probability of observing disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 on word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 The most likely parse of a sentence is one where the sum over mutual informatio
n is maximized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The term 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,*\right)$
\end_inset

 looks uneventful, but hides a more complex structure.
 One has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
p\left(w,*\right) & = & \sum_{d}p\left(w,d\right)\\
 & = & \sum_{c}p\left(w;c\right)+\sum_{c_{1},c_{2}}p\left(w;c_{1},c_{2}\right)+\sum_{c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}}p\left(w;c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}\right)+\cdots
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where the sums over 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset

 are sums over all connectors appearing in some disjunct.
 Keep in mind that each connector can connect to the left or to the right:
 a connector is a word, plus a direction indicator.
 To bridge the notation back to that of the Ising model, one would write
 for the loss function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J_{ijk\cdots}=-\log_{2}p\left(w,d\right)=-\log_{2}p\left(w;\left(w_{i},x_{i}\right),\left(w_{j},x_{j}\right),\left(w_{k},x_{k}\right),\cdots\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}=\left(w_{k},x_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 is a connector with word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{k}$
\end_inset

 and direction 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, writing 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 for a disjunct is much simpler than writing out the mass of connectors;
 yet the notation can be deceiving because it hides the complexity of the
 model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Graph Algorithms vs.
 Gradient Descent 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous sections illustrate that the CBOW/SkipGram model is a form
 of a maximum-entropy model, and that the disjunct model of natural language
 is amenable to the same treatment.
 In one case, the word-context is an N-gram; in the other, it is a disjunct;
 but these are not so unlike one-another, they have much in common.
 Both langauge models share a common difficulty: finding an energy functional
 that correctly models the observed probability distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several generic classes of algorithms that can be applied to obtain
 the energy functional.
 One class are termed Monte Carlo methods, driving either hill-climbing,
 gradient descent or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

relaxation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 algorithms; deep learning algorithms fall in this class.
 The other class of algorithms can be loosely called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

graph algorithms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These accumulate frequency counts on low-arity observed relationships,
 and use the logarithm of these frequencies as a surrogate for the energy
 functional.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The class of Mone Carlo methods can be said to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

global
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in that they are trying to navigate an extremely large energy functional
 landscape through random sampling.
 By contrast, the graph algorithms are manifestly local, and re-assemble
 the global landscape explicitly by means of Feynman diagrams and vacuum
 contributions, as illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Feynman-Diagrams"

\end_inset

.
 The graphical algorithms expose the graph network structure immediately;
 in the above examples, as maximum spanning trees that can be found using
 greedy algorithms applied to pair-wise relationships.
 The Monte Carlo algorithms do not provide any manifest graphical structure,
 although perhaps one can be discerned by applying some sort of thresholding
 to eliminate weak links.
 Indeed, thresholding, using sigmoid functions to prune unwanted, weak weights
 from a neural net is a characteristic of most deep-learning models.
 Even so, the resulting weight vectors and weight matrices tend to be cryptic
 amorphous masses: large blocks of uninterpretable numbers whose precise
 role and importance seems impossible to discern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Graph Algorithms vs.
 Monte Carlo for Word Pairs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difference between graphical and Monte Carlo methods is perhaps best
 illustrated by example.
 Yuret assumes an Ising model of natural language, and considers only pair-wise
 word realtionships.
 To obtain an energy functional, it suffices to count the frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w_{left},w_{right}\right)$
\end_inset

 of word-pairs, and then to take for granted that the energy functional
 is accurately estimated by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(w_{left},w_{right}\right)=-\log_{2}\left[\frac{N\left(w_{left},w_{right}\right)}{N\left(*,*\right)}\right]
\]

\end_inset

To obtain dependency parses that agree with those deemed acceptable by professio
nal linguists, maximum spanning trees are constructed, taking into account
 the important role of the left and right marginal frequencies 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(*,w\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w,*\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The result is an explict dependency graph for every possible sentence.
 That the ensemble is an explict Boltzmann distribution is a primary point
 of figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could have approached this problem from the Monte Carlo direction as
 well, as is done by McDonald
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McDonald2005,McDonald2006"

\end_inset

: one trains up a model by defining a cost function, and then performs hill
 climbing or gradient descent on it.
 The result is still a pair-wise cost function, and a dependency parse is
 obtained by searching for an MST tree, just as before.
 For McDonald, there is no overt relationship to the principle of maximum
 entropy; it is either covert, or perhaps one could say its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more general
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by not constraining to fit the cost function to a probabilistic framework.
 The need for this generality does not seem to be well-supported.
 There does not appear to be any data to indicate if some other pair-wise
 cost function provides a superior MST-tree, as compared to using the MI.
 Although this is an open question, there's no particular hint that this
 could be a fruitful direction to take.

\begin_inset Formula $p\left(*,*\right)=1$
\end_inset

 The

 is just the observational count of observing the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w,d\right)$

The enemble of all possible grammatical word-sequences has the form of a

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 The most likely relationship between the words in a sentence is the one
 that maximizes the entropy, including the contribution of the vacuum; and
 thus looks like a maximization of mutual information.
 Because disjuncts impose a complex relationship between words, one must
 use more complex algorithms, generically called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parsers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, to discover how to attach disjuncts to one-another to obtain a valid nateork
 graph.
 The original Link grammar papers
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 provide an eminently suitable parsing algorithm that is well-suited to
 the task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By contrast, the CBOW/SkipGram models use gradient-descent to obtain a probabili
ty similar to 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The notation used is different, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{j}\left|w_{I}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

 is written, with the N-gram context 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{I}$
\end_inset

 as a stand-in for the disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 Previous sections above point out that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{I}$
\end_inset

 is a lot like 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

; for some purposes (many purposes?) they can be treated as being the same
 thing.
 The big difference is that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{I}$
\end_inset

 is lacking the grammatical structure that 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 encodes; there is some buried graph-like structure in 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{I}$
\end_inset

 but it is not overt, and one must work to make it overt.
 One can use the disjuncts directly, with a suitable parsing algorithm,
 to obtain an explicit dependency parse of any given sentence.
 The actual probability function 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{j}\left|w_{I}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

 is treated as an unknown, to be obtained by gradient descent algorithms,
 constrained only by the core assumption of either eqn

\begin_layout Subsection
Avoiding Maximum Entropy Principles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous sections explicitly focused on maximum entropy as a guiding
 principle, emphasizing that it is compatible with both a graphical algorithm
 approach, as well as a Monte Carlo or gradient descent approach to learning
 a language model.
 This guiding principle can be set to the side and ignored; there is nothing
 specific in either the graph algorithms or the training algorithms that
 require or assume it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider again the mechanism used to obtain the counts 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The first half of this mechanism is commonly called MST parsing (Maximum
 Spanning Tree parsing), and is described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yuret1998"

\end_inset

.
 It is a form of a greedy graph algorithm.
 One begins by considering the graph clique, wherein every word in the sentence
 is related (joined by an edge) to every other word in a sentence.
 Each edge is associated with a metric, that defines the length or size
 of the edge.
 In traditional MST, this metric is the mutual information of the word-pair.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Properly speaking, mutual information is not a metric, since it does not
 obey the triangle inequality.
 Thus, it should be called a divergence (it is essentially the Kullback–Liebler
 dirvergence) in that it distinguishes points by thier divergence, without
 providing a specific distance betwen them.
 Despite this, the divergence will be called either a matric or a distance
 in much of what follows, simply because it rolls off the tongue more easily.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 One can proceed in three ways from here: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Apply thresholding, and discard all edges that have a weak, low quality
 connection.
 The result may be a disconnected graph, or a multiply-connected graph.
 A fixed threshold might reject too much, or it might reject too little.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Apply a greedy algorithm, and keep only the edges of the highest quality,
 until a spanning tree is found, spanning all words in the sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A combination of the two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last may be the best.
 In traditional linguistics, one is interested in a parse tree that connects
 all of the words in a sentence, and thus indicates which words are related
 to which.
 More connections than what is in the spanning tree just confuse the issue,
 at least for traditional linguistics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For disjunct counting, insisting on a spanning tree might be too strong
 a condition.
 For disjunct counting, one is only interested in how words connect to other
 words: one is interested in extracting and counting the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

jigsaw puzzle pieces
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that represent how words can connect to other words.
 To obtain these jigsaw-puzzle pieces, one does not need a tree that spans
 all words in the sentence; it is acceptable that some words might be omitted.
 Nor is it strictly necessary that the parse graph be a tree: it is OK if
 it has cycles, since these cycles often indicate important grammatical
 relations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A spanning-tree algorithm can be thought of as a kind-of thresholding algorithm,
 but with a local, dynamically-adjustable threshold.
 When a word has very strong connections to all other words, one might consider
 dynamically adjusting a threshold to a high value; when a word has only
 weak connections to all other words, one might dynamically adjust the threshold
 to a low value.
 This type of dynamically-adjustable thresholding can be confusing to define
 and difficult to optimize; by contrast, the spanning tree is simple and
 direct.
 At an abstract level, though, the differences can be imagined to be less
 than they first appear.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The net result is that by observing disjuncts, one is observing an explicit
 graphical structure.
 The disjunct is overt, in the foreground, explicitly demonstrated.
 It is obtained by explicitly searching for a graphical structure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because every graph has a corresponding adjacency matrix, one can always
 approach the problem from the other direction: given a matrix, declare
 it to be a graph, with the matrix entries being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

weights
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the graph edges.
 This is the approach taken by the neural net, deep-learning models.
 They clearly have taken the world by storm, and are quite successful in
 what they do.
 The disadvantage is that they obscure the explicit graphical structure
 of natural language.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Model Building and Vector Representations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key driver behind the deep-learning models is the replacement of intractable
 probabilistic models by those that are computationally efficient.
 This is accomplished in several stages.
 First, the full-text probability function 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\mbox{sentence}\left|\mbox{ fulltext}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

 is replaced by the much simpler probability function 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\mbox{word}\left|\mbox{ fulltext}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The former probability function is extremely high-dimensional, whereas
 the later is less so.
 Its still computationally infeasible, so there are two directions one can
 go in.
 The traditional bag-of-words model replaces 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fulltext
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

set of words in the fulltext
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 AKA the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bag
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and so one computes 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\mbox{word}\left|\mbox{ bag}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

 which is computationally feasible.
 Algorithms such as TF-IDF, and many others accomplish this.
 The characteristic idea here is to ignore the (syntactic) structure of
 the full-text, completely erasing all indication of word-order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bag, however, loses syntactic and semantic structure, and so goes to
 far.
 An alternate route is to start with 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\mbox{word}\left|\mbox{ fulltext}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

 and simplify it by using instead a sliding-window probability function
 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\mbox{word}\left|\mbox{ window}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

, thus giving the N-gram model.
 The characteristic idea here is to explicitly set 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\mbox{word}\left|\mbox{ other-words}\right.\right)=0$
\end_inset

 whenever the other-words are not in the window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The N-gram model is still computationally intractable for 
\begin_inset Formula $N\ge3$
\end_inset

 and so the deep-learning models propose that yet more entries in 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\mbox{word}\left|\mbox{ window}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

 can be ignored or conflated.
 Conceptually, the models propose computing 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\mbox{word}\left|\mbox{ context}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

 with the context being a projection to a low-dimensional space.
 These ideas can be illustrated more precisely.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{v}_{I}=\vec{v}_{t-c}\times\vec{v}_{t-c+1}\times\cdots\times\vec{v}_{t+c}
\]

\end_inset

be the context, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{w}=\pi\hat{e}_{w}$
\end_inset

 the projection of the unit vector of the word down to the low-dimensional
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hidden layer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vector space.
 This projection can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{I}=\left[\pi\oplus\cdots\oplus\pi\right]\left(\hat{e}_{t-c}\times\hat{e}_{t-c+1}\times\cdots\times\hat{e}_{t-c}\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\oplus\cdots\oplus\pi$
\end_inset

 is the block-diagonal matrix 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\pi\oplus\cdots\oplus\pi=\begin{bmatrix}\pi & 0\\
0 & \pi\\
 &  & \ddots\\
 &  &  & \pi & 0\\
 &  &  & 0 & \pi
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\end_inset

and so the off-block-diagonal entries are explicitly assumed to be zero,
 as an 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 built-in assumption.
 Note that the zero entries in this matrix greatly outnumber the non-zero
 entries.
 Almost all entries are zero.
 
\end_layout

Its useful to keep tabs on these sizes.
 The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 was 
\begin_inset Formula $D\times W$
\end_inset

-dimensional, with 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 the number of vocabulary words (as always) and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dimension.
 For a window of size 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\oplus\cdots\oplus\pi$
\end_inset

 has dimensions 
\begin_inset Formula $ND\times NW$
\end_inset

.
 Of these, only 
\begin_inset Formula $NDW$
\end_inset

 are non-zero, the remaining 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(N-1\right)DW$
\end_inset

 are zero.
 That's a lot of zeros.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can do one of several things with the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{I}$
\end_inset

.
 In the SkipGram and CBOW models, one sums over words; that is, one creates
 the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i\in I}\vec{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Its worth writing this out, matrix style.
 One has that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{i\in I}\vec{v}_{i}=S\vec{v_{I}}
\]

\end_inset

where the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a concatenation of identity matrices.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=\left[\left|\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1\\
 &  & \ddots\\
 &  &  & 1
\end{array}\right|\left|\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1\\
 &  & \ddots\\
 &  &  & 1
\end{array}\right|\cdots\left|\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1\\
 &  & \ddots\\
 &  &  & 1
\end{array}\right|\right]
\]

\end_inset

The reason for writing it out in this way to understand that there is another
 dimensional reduction: again, almost all entries in this matrix are zero.
 Each identity matrix was 
\begin_inset Formula $D\times D$
\end_inset

 dimensional, and there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 of them, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 has dimensions 
\begin_inset Formula $D\times ND$
\end_inset

.
 Of these, there are only 
\begin_inset Formula $ND$
\end_inset

 non-zero entries; the remaining 
\begin_inset Formula $ND\left(D-1\right)$
\end_inset

 are all zero.
 The reduction is huge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the perceptron model of Bengio, the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is replaced by a weight matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 projecting to the perceptron layer.
 All of the entries in the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 are, by assumption, non-zero.
 This perhaps helps make it clear just how much more complex the perceptron
 model is.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is an approximately square matrix, this implies a large-number of non-zero
 entries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its worth getting an intuitive feeling for the size of these numbers: following
 Mikolov, assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $W=10^{4}$
\end_inset

 although this sharply underestimates the size of the vocabulary of English.
 Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $N=5$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D=300$
\end_inset

.
 The size of the input vector space is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{N}=10^{20}$
\end_inset

, this is being modeled by a vector space of size 300.
 The sparsity is thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\log_{2}\frac{10^{20}}{300}=31.3\mbox{ bits}
\]

\end_inset

A truly vast amount of potential information is being discarded by this
 language model.
 Of course, the claim is that the English language never carried this much
 information in the first place: almost all five-word sequences are meaningless
 non-sense; only a very small number of these are syntactically valid, and
 somewhat fewer are semantically meaningful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This exposes the real question: just how meaningful are the CBOW/SkipGram
 models, and can one find better models that also have

The last question can be answered by noting that the Link Grammar disjunct

\begin_layout Standard
Here, as always, 
\begin_inset Formula $W=\left|w\right|$
\end_inset

 is the number of observed vocabulary words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|d\right|$
\end_inset

 is the number of observed disjuncts, and the sparsity is the log of number
 of non-zero pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

, measured in bits:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sparsity}=-\log_{2}\frac{\left|\left(w,d\right)\right|}{\left|w\right|\left|d\right|}
\]

\end_inset

Notable in the above report is that the measured sparsity seems to be approximat
ely language-independent, and dataset-size independent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the observed sparsity is due to a lack of a sufficient number of
 observations of language use.
 Some of the sparsity is due to the fact that certain combinations really
 are forbidden: one really cannot string words in arbitrary order.
 What fraction of the sparsity is due to which effect is unclear.
 Curiously, increasing the number of observations (en_cfive vs.
 en_mtwo) increased the sparsity; but this could also be due to the much
 larger vocabulary, which is now even more rarely observed.
 A significant part of the expanded vocabulary includes Latin and other
 foreign-language words, which, of necessity, will be very infrequent, and
 when they occur, they will be in set phrases that readers are expected
 to recognize.
 The point here is that one cannot induce a foreign-language grammar from
 a small number of set phrases embedded in English text.
 A major portion of the expanded vocabulary are geographical place names,
 product names and the like, which are also inherently sparse.
 Unlike the foreign phrases, this does not mean that they are inflexible
 in grammatical usage: one can use the name of a small town in a vast number
 of sentences, even if the observed corpus uses it in only a few.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two more factors compound the confusion.
 One is that the observed text will necessarily contain grammatically-incorrect
 text: the occasional mis-spelled word, the occasional awkwardly worded
 phrase; omitted determiners, incorrect number, tense agreement.
 A far more serious issue is that the disjuncts are constructed by means
 of MST parsing, which has a reasonably large error rate: based on reports
 from Yuret
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yuret1998"

\end_inset

 and others, one can expect parses that are 80% to 90% accurate; the fraction
 of incorrect disjuncts may range from 5% to 20%.
 Incorrect disjuncts decrease the observed sparsity: they make some observations
 more frequent than they should be, but only because they're wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compared to the back-of-the-envelope estimate of sparsity for SkipGrams,
 the numbers reported above are much lower.
 There are several ways to interpret this: the simple disjunct model, as
 presented above, fails to compress sufficiently well, or the SkipGram model
 compresses too much.
 Its likely that both situations are the case.

\begin_layout Standard
Natural language does not have a large-data limit.
 More generally, Zipf distributions cannot have a large-data limit.
 This is in contrast to normal distributions, where the large-data limit
 is a Gaussian.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ignoring 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sparsity due to forbidden grammatical constructions, it is also the case
 that the input dataset 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 is both noisy and incomplete.
 It is noisy because the sample size is not sufficiently large to adequately
 approach a large-sample-size limit.
 Reaching this limit is fundamentally impossible, from first principles,
 if one assumes the Zipf distribution (as is the case here).
 For a Zipf distribution, half the dataset necessarily consists of 
\emph on
hapax legomena
\emph default
.
 Another 15% to 20% are 
\emph on
dis
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
tris legomena
\emph default
.
 Increasing the number of observations do not change these ratios: the more
 one observes, the more singular phenomena one will find.
 Noise in the dataset is unavoidable.
 Furthermore, implicit in this is that the dataset is necessarily incomplete:
 if half the dataset consists of events that were observed just once; there
 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

even more
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 events, that were never observed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider, for example, the set of short sentences.
 One might think that, if one was able to observe every sentence ever spoken
 or written, one might eventually observe ever grammatically valid noun-verb
 combination.
 This is not so.
 The sentence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

green ideas sleep furiously
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is quite common, as it is a stock example sentence in linguistics.
 However, the similar sentence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

blue concepts wilt skillfully
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 probably has never been written down before, until just now.
 The law of large numbers does not apply to the Zipfian distribution.
 The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 is necessarily noisy and incomplete, no mater how large the sample size.
 What is not clear is what fraction of the sparsity is due to the Zipf distribut
ion, and what fraction is the sparsity is due to forbidden grammatical construct
ions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Word Classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In operational practice, dependency grammars work with word-classes, and
 not with words.
 That is, one carves up the set of words into grammatical classes, such
 as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
 and then assign words to each.
 Each grammatical class is associated with a set of disjuncts that indicate
 how a word in that class can attach to words in other classes.
 This can be made notationally precise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 and the disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 it was observed with, the goal is to classify it into some grammatical
 category 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 The probability of this usage is 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,d,g)$
\end_inset

, and it should factorize into two distinct parts:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w,d,g\right)=p^{\prime}\left(w|g\right)p^{\prime\prime}\left(g,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

None of the three probabilities above are known, a priori, and not even
 the number of grammatical classes are known at the outset.
 Instead, one has the observational data, that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w,d\right)=p\left(w,d,*\right)=\sum_{g\in G}p\left(w,d,g\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is the set of all grammatical classes.
 The goal is then to determine the set 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and to perform the matrix factorization
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p\left(w,d\right)\approx\sum_{g\in G}p^{\prime}\left(w|g\right)p^{\prime\prime}\left(g,d\right)\label{eq:factorize}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Ideally, the size of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is minimal, in some way, so that the matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\prime}(w|g)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\prime\prime}(g,d)$
\end_inset

 are of low rank.
 In the extreme case of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 having only one element, total, the factorization is the same as the outer
 product, or tensor product, of two vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following, the prime-superscripts are dropped, and the joint probabilitie
s are written as 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,g)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(g,d)$
\end_inset

.
 These are two different probabilities; which in turn are not the same as
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Which one is which should be apparent from context.
 The probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w|g\right)$
\end_inset

 is a conditional probability: 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w|g\right)=p\left(w,g\right)/p\left(*,g\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This is used to ensure that the factorization of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:factorize"

\end_inset

, as well as the factors, all behave correctly as a joint probabilities:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
p\left(*,d\right) & = & \sum_{w}p\left(w,d\right)\\
 & = & \sum_{w}\sum_{g}p\left(w|g\right)p\left(g,d\right)\\
 & = & \sum_{w}\sum_{g}\frac{p\left(w,g\right)}{p\left(*,g\right)}p\left(g,d\right)\\
 & = & \sum_{g}p\left(g,d\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

and all joint probabilites normalize correctly: 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(*,*\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways of performing the factorization of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:factorize"

\end_inset

: by applying graphical methods (such as clustering) or by applying gradient
 descent methods (typically associated with neural net algorithms).
 These two approaches are explored below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Learning Word Senses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the factorization is to capture semantic information along with
 syntactic information.
 Typically, any given 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 pair might belong to only one grammatical category.
 So, for example, the pair
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	girl: the-;
\end_layout

\end_inset

would be associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $g=\mathtt{<common-count-nouns>}$
\end_inset

.
 This captures the idea that girls, boys, houses and birds fall into the
 same class, and require the use of a determiner when being directly referenced.
 This is distinct from mass nouns, which do not require determiners.
 This suggests that, to a large degree, the factorization might be approximately
 block-diagonal, at least for the words; that 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

 might usually have only one non-zero entry for a fixed word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this assumption should break down, the larger the size of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose one had classes 
\begin_inset Formula $g=\mathtt{<cutting-actions>}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g=\mathtt{<looking-verbs>}$
\end_inset

; the assignment of 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	saw: I- & wood+;
\end_layout

\end_inset

would have non-zero probabilities for both 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

's.
 For a large number of classes, one might expect to find many distinctions:
 girls and boys differ from houses and birds, and one even might expect
 to find sex differences: girls pout, and boys punch, while houses and birds
 do neither.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Put differently, one expects different classes to not only differentiate
 crud syntactic structure, but also to indicate intensional properties.
 Based on practical experience, we expect that most words would fall into
 at most ten, almost always less than twenty different classes: this can
 be seen by cracking open any dictionary, and counting the number of word
 senses for a given word.
 Likewise for intentional properties: birds sing, tweet and fly and a few
 other verbs.
 Houses mostly are, or get something (get built, get destroyed).
 That is, we expect 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

 to be sparse: there might be thousands (or more!) elements in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, but no more than a few dozen 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

, and often much less, will be non-zero, for a fixed word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Clustering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A side effect of the matrix factorization of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:factorize"

\end_inset

 is that it is a 
\emph on
de facto
\emph default
 form of clustering.
 Whenever one has 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,g)>0$
\end_inset

, one can effectively say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 has been assigned to cluster 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Thus, solving eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:factorize"

\end_inset

 can be seen as an alternative to deploying a clustering algorithm to assign
 words to word classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Multiple class membership
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important distinction between traditional clustering and matrix factorizatio
n is that traditional clustering algorithms naively assign a word to only
 a single cluster, whereas here, one can have multiple 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,g)>0$
\end_inset

.
 One can partly overcome this difficulty with traditional clustering by
 decomposing the input vector into two: a component parallel to the cluster
 centroid, and a perpendicular component, and assigning the parallel component
 to the cluster, while leaving behind the perpendicular component to be
 assigned to other clusters.
 The decomposition need not be strict about parallelism: one might choose
 to merge the component that lies within some angle (or distance) of the
 cluster centroid.
 Each such merge then gradually shifts the centroid over.
 If the left-over perpendicular component is sufficiently small, it can
 be discarded as noise, or treated as an anomaly awaiting additional data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This splitting of a vector into components, and then placing each component
 in a different cluster might perhaps be reminiscent of fuzzy clustering,
 where one object may be placed into two clusters.
 However, what is proposed above is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 fuzzy clustering.
 The goal is disambiguate a word precisely into the intended sense, and
 to assign that sense to a cluster.
 The goal is not to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oh, maybe it is this, and maybe it is that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A more precise formulation of this statement is taken up in a later section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-means clustering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clustering, and in particular, 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-means clustering, can be shown to be equivalent to matrix factorization.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 In particular, the equations that define 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-means as a relaxation problem, of aligning vectors to the closes centroids,
 can be written explicitly as matrices.
 This equivalence is reviewed in the section after the next, after a sufficient
 amount of other mathematical devices have been set up.
 Most important of these is the choice of an appropriate information metric
 (instead of cosine distance) for the clustering norm, together with a justifica
tion of why this is necessary.
 This needs to be coupled to an appropriate mechanism for performing multiple
 class membership.
\end_layout

Once this is done, clustering can be re-interpreted as more of a graphical
 method, as opposed to an optimization method.

MST (Agglomerative) Clustering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MST clustering is a form of greedy clustering, attempting to first connect
 all points in the dataset with a tree that minimizes the the distance between
 the points, and then removing some of the longest edges, leaving behind
 a set of connected components.
 MST clustering can be fairly efficient, as one can find provisionally minimal
 trees with a fairly small number of distance evaluations, using a greedy
 algorithm; the provisional minimal tree can then be adjusted using local
 relaxation.

There are a variety of criticisms of different clustering algorithms, pointing
 at various drawbacks.
 Some of these criticisms do not apply to the current problem, and so are
 not to be used in selecting a better algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Convex clusters.
 This is a standard criticism leveled against 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-means clustering: the clusters can only ever be convex.
 This is important criticism, when working with low-dimensional data (2D,
 3D data) where perhaps most practical examples require clusters that are
 not convex.
 For the language learning problem, the data lives in an extremely high-dimensio
nal space, with clusters that are almost surely convex.

Low Rank Matrix Approximation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Factorizations of the form of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 are not uncommon in machine learning.
 They generally go under the name of Low Rank Matrix Approximation (LRMA).
 The rank refers to the size of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 – it is the rank of the matrices in the factorization.
 The factorization is only an approximation to the original data; thus,
 one says LRMA and not LRMF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Closely related is the concept of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF
 or NNMF),
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WP-NNMF"

\end_inset

 where the focus is on keeping matrix entries positive, as would be appropriate
 for probabilities.
 Furthermore, a matrix of probabilities is not just non-negative; it also
 has non-negative rank; 
\emph on

\emph default
.
 every non-negative linear combination of the rows or columns must also
 be non-negative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is known that the factorization of non-negative matrices with non-negative
 rank is an NP-hard problem.
 Factorization can be seen as generalizing 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-means clustering, which is known to be NP-complete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A variety of techniques for performing this factorization have been developed.
 A lightning review is given below.
 The point of the review is less to edify the reader, than it is to point
 out which techniques, formulas and metrics are the most appropriate for
 the present situation, namely, eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 for probabilities, coupled to the need for fairly crisp word-sense disambiguati
on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Probabilistic Matrix Factorization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) assumes that the observation counts
 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 are normally distributed (i.e.
 are Gaussian).
 The factorization is then obtained by minimizing the Frobenius norm of
 the difference of the left and right sides.
 That is, one defines the error matrix (or residual matrix) 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(w,d\right)=\left|p\left(w,d\right)-\sum_{g\in G}p\left(w|g\right)p\left(g,d\right)\right|
\]

\end_inset

and from this, the objective function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=\sum_{w,d}\left|E\left(w,d\right)\right|^{2}
\]

\end_inset

After fixing the dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G\right|$
\end_inset

, one searches for the matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w|g\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(g,d\right)$
\end_inset

 that minimize the objective function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary drawbacks of probabilistic matrix factorization is that it does
 not provide any guarantees or mechanism to keep the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w|g\right)$
\end_inset

 sparse.
 It's not built on information-theoretic infrastructure: it is not leveraging
 the idea that the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

's are probabilities; it does not consider the information content of the
 problem.
 From first principles, it would seem that information maximization would
 be a desirable property.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assumption that the matrix entries are normally distributed are also
 in a direct collision course with the known fact that the distribution
 of the matrix entries are Zipfian, as argued in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Zipf's-Law;-Noise"

\end_inset

.
 Although one can compute a mean or expectation value for the 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

, creating a histogram around this mean value will not reveal a curve in
 the shape of a Gaussian.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some words occur with frequencies that are many orders of magnitude larger
 than others.
 The Frobenius norm then becomes very strict for the former, and very loose
 for the latter.
 It leads to a situation where improving the factorization by 1% for a high
 frequency word is equivalent to being wrong by factors of 2 or 3 on low-frequen
cy words.
 This does not seem like a plusible weighting scheme.
 The Frobenius norm seems less than ideal for the problem at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Nuclear Norm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever the error matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 can be decomposed into a set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \sigma_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 of singular values, then the trace of the decomposition is 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\sum_{i}\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The trace can be treated as the objective function to be minimized, leading
 to a valid factorization, differing from that obtained by PMF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nuclear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 comes from operator theory, where the definition of a nuclear operator
 as one that is of trace-class, i.e.
 having a trace that is invariant under orthogonal or unitary transformations.
 In such cases, there is an explicit assumption that the operator lives
 in some homogeneous space,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WP-Homogenous-space"

\end_inset

 where orthogonal or unitary transformations can be applied.
 From an initial, naive point of view, this seems appropriate for machine
 learning.
 In machine learning, the spaces are always finite dimensional, and are
 usually explicitly assumed to be real Euclidean space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 – that is, the spaces behave like actual vector spaces, so that concepts
 like PCA and SVD can be applied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subtle point here is that the space in which 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 lives is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 (nor is it 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{\left|W\right|\times\left|D\right|}$
\end_inset

, if one is a stickler about dimensions).
 Rather, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 is constrained to live inside of a simplex (of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|W\right|\times\left|D\right|$
\end_inset

).
 Sure, one can blur one's eyes and imagine that this simplex is a subspace
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{\left|W\right|\times\left|D\right|}$
\end_inset

, and that is not entirely wrong.
 However, the only transformations that can be applied to points in a simplex,
 that keep the points inside the simplex, are Markov matrices.
 Any other transformations will typically move points into the inside from
 the outside, and move inside points to the outside.
 In particular, rotations (orthogonal transformations) cannot be applied
 to a probability, such that the result is still a probability.
 Applying the notion of a trace, which is implicitly defined as being invariant
 under orthogonal transformations, is inappropriate for the problem at hand.
 What would be appropriate is some sort of trace-like invariant that transforms
 as a scalar under Markov transformations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is similar to PMF, but with the
 additional constraint that the result has a non-negative rank.
 The non-negative rank constraint requires that not only do the factor matrices
 have non-negative values in them, but also that non-negative linear combination
s are also non-negative.
 This appears be an appropriate restriction for probabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A reasonable review of NMF is given in
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Eggert2004"

\end_inset

, which also describes how one can control the sparsity of the resulting
 factors.
 Control over sparsity is one reason that clustering techniques are interesting;
 something as fast or faster that offers control over sparsity is appealing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NMF using the Kullback-Leibler divergence is equivalent to Probabilistic
 Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI), although the two commonly used algorithms
 for each are quite different, and each is able to climb out of local minima
 of the other.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ding2008"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The error term that needs to be minimized is the matrix-factorized form
 of the mutual information, which is just the Kullback-Leibler divergence
 between the factored and unfactored matrices: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
MI_{\mbox{factor}}=\sum_{w,d}p\left(w,d\right)\log\frac{p\left(w,d\right)}{\sum_{g\in G}p\left(w|g\right)p\left(g,d\right)}\label{eq:KL-MI-factorization-loss}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In essence, this measures the information loss in moving from the full distribut
ion 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 to the factorized version; for a good factorization, one wishes to minimize
 this information loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Projective Probability Amplitudes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous sections argue that when vectors are interpreted as probabilities,
 then dot-products and invariance under orthogonal transformations are inappropr
iate, because these transform probabilities into things that cannot be interpret
ed as probabilities.
 Intuitively, information-theoretic manipulations that preserve the probability
 aspects seem wiser.
 However, there is another possibility: work with probability amplitudes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A vector is a probability, if one has that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{n}p_{n}=1
\]

\end_inset

That is, a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}$
\end_inset

 is constrained to live on the surface of a simplex.
 One can apply a simple trick: just write 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}=\sqrt{p_{n}}$
\end_inset

 and then the constraint becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{n}a_{n}^{2}=1
\]

\end_inset

Clearly, the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{a}$
\end_inset

 is constrained to live on the surface of a sphere.
 Now, orthogonal rotations do not violate this constraint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies that nurclear norms, or Frobenius norms might be quite appropriate,
 if, instead of working with 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}$
\end_inset

, one worked with 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{a}$
\end_inset

.
 To be more specific, define 
\begin_inset Formula $a\left(w,d\right)=\sqrt{p\left(w,d\right)}$
\end_inset

 and then define an error matrix (residual matrix) 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(w,d\right)=\left|a\left(w,d\right)-\sum_{g\in G}a\left(w;g\right)a\left(g;d\right)\right|
\]

\end_inset

and then, to assign word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 to word-sense cluster 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, seek to minimize the objective function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=\sum_{w,d}\left|E\left(w,d\right)\right|^{2}
\]

\end_inset

This seems like a plausible objective function, if the 
\begin_inset Formula $a\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 are normally distributed.
 But, as argued in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Zipf's-Law;-Noise"

\end_inset

, this is a faulty assumption.
 As noted before, this error matrix causes high-frequency words to strongly
 dominate over low-frequency words in the factorization.
 Again, this seems like an implausbile objective function for natural language
 or any Zipfian distributions.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

can be viewed as just one special function of the vector components indexed
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 More generally, one can consider the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(q_{1},q_{2},\cdots,q_{n}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{g}=p\left(w|g\right)p\left(g,d\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\left|G\right|$
\end_inset

 the number of elements in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 Thus, the matrix factorization is just the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(q_{1},q_{2},\cdots,q_{n}\right)=q_{1}+q_{2}+\cdots+q_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The neural net matrix factorization

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The loss of linearity in this model seems like a rather extreme proposal.
 The fact that it is effective may in fact be a symptom of unknown, underlying
 structure.
 For example, there is nothing in the current formulation of the natural
 language problem that suggests this as an appropriate model of language.
 See, however, the next section, on factorization ambiguity, that suggests
 that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shape
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of language consists of a tight, highly-interconnected nucleus, attached
 to sparse feeder trees.
 That nucleus itself has additional structure.
 It might be the case that this complex structure can be captured by an
 
\emph on
ad hoc
\emph default
 model consisting of some non-linear function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 However, in the end, this just suggests that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is just hiding or modeling or leaving unexplored some deeper linear structure.

Local Low Rank Matrix Factorization (LLORMA)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is a matrix factorization algorithm exhibiting accuracy and performance
 at near state-of-the-art levels.
 It uses a combination of two techniques: kernel smoothing
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WP-Kernel-smoother"

\end_inset

 and local regression (LOESS)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WP-Local-regression"

 to obtain smooth estimates for the two factors 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(g,d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two techniques, combined, prove to be almost ideal, when faced with
 incomplete data, and when the data is noisy.
 Specifically, the idea of incompleteness is that some values of the input
 dataset 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 are zero not because they fundamentally should be (i.e.
 are forbidden by the grammar and syntax of natural language), but are zero
 simply because they have not yet been observed; some appropriate sentence
 does not occur in the sample dataset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, the use of the smoothing techniques seems highly appropriate, given
 that the input dataset 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 is both noisy and incomplete, as discussed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Zipf's-Law;-Noise"

\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, the use of LLORMA, as strictly described, seems inappropriate,
 but only because the use of the Frobenius norm or the nuclear norm is inappropr
iate for this dataset.
 The correct norm must be that of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:KL-MI-factorization-loss"

\end_inset

.
 It seems reasonable to beleive that combining kernel smoothing with local
 regression and the information-theoretic norm might yeild an excellent
 algorithm for factoring joint probabilities.
 As an algorithm, it belongs to the gradient-descent class.

One may show that

 matrix decomposition with an extra orthogonality condition enforced; this

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The orthogonality condition can be loosened, as the process of factorization

 In effect, 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-means clustering is a special case of matrix factorization: its factorization
 with extra constraints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ding

 examine several forms of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-means clustering.
 The simplest form of clustering assigns vectors to clusters, and stops
 there.
 This is equivalent to assigning words to word-classes, without making any
 specific statements about what happened to the disjuncts.
 Alternately, one could say that the disjuncts just went along for the ride:
 they were associated with some word before-hand, and they are now still
 associated with that word, thrown into a bucket with the other disjuncts
 of similar words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bipartite graph clustering (aka 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

co-clustering

\end_inset

) recognizes that the input data can be viewed as a bipartite graph (fig
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Factorization"

\end_inset

, left image), and that one can perform separate, distinct, but simultaneous
 clustering on the columns, and separately, the rows.
 This is closer to the desired factorization model for language, and so
 the proof is reviewed here.
 It is still 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-means clustering, just that one performs two clusterings, not one, on the
 columns, and on the rows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matrix to be factorized is 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and the desired factorization is 
\begin_inset Formula $B\approx LR^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Comparing this to the factorization of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:factorize"

\end_inset

, the matrix elements of 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset


\series default
 are 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

; those of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w|g\right)$
\end_inset

; those of 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{T}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(g,d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Key to the proof is the reinterpretation of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 as membership matrices, so that each row and column indicate the membership
 of a vector to a cluster.
 That is 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 consists of column vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $L=\left[\vec{l}_{1},\vec{l}_{2},\cdots,\vec{l}_{k}\right]$
\end_inset

 where each column vector is of the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{l}_{j}=\left(0,0,\cdots0,1,1,\cdots,1,0,\cdots,0\right)^{T}
\]

\end_inset

with the 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

's indicating the cluster membership.
 That is, the matrix elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L_{ij}=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{ item }i\mbox{ belongs to cluster }j\\
0 & \mbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

Hard clustering means that any given 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 belongs to only one 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, and so one trivially has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j}L_{ij}=1$
\end_inset

, which is a key property of a Markov matrix.
 That is, hard clustering has the Markov property.
 Equivalently, the factorization for the hard-clustering of words into single
 classes is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w|g\right)=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{ word }w\mbox{ belongs to wordclass }g\\
0 & \mbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

That is, every word belongs to some class, with 100% probability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The optimization problem is then to find the maxima of two objective functions,
 subject to some constraints:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\max_{L\ge0;L^{T}L\sim I}\mbox{tr}L^{T}BB^{T}L\;\mbox{ and }\;\max_{R\ge0;R^{T}R\sim I}\mbox{tr}R^{T}B^{T}BR
\]

\end_inset

The constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{T}L\sim I$
\end_inset

 means that not only should 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{T}L$
\end_inset

 be a diagonal matrix, but that it should be a multiple of the identity
 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 – that is, have equal values along the diagonal.
 Here, the tr operator is the matrix trace.
 The trace of a matrix is, of course, equal to the sum of the eigenvalues
 of the matrix; thus, optimizing the above is equivalent to performing a
 singular value decomposition (SVD) of the traced matrix, and then summing
 the singular values.
 This is, of course, just the nuclear norm discussed previously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With some relatively straightforward algebraic manipulation, the above can
 be shown to be equivalent to optimizing 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\min\left\Vert B-LR^{T}\right\Vert ^{2}
\]

\end_inset

subject to the same constraints.
 The norm 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \cdot\right\Vert ^{2}$
\end_inset

 is the Frobenius norm.
 In this sense, hard 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-means clustering is identical to matrix factorization.
 Removing some of the constraints shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-means clustering is a special case of the more general factorization problem.
 Ding 
\emph on
et al
\emph default
 show that if one removes the orthogonality constraints, the resulting factors
 are still approximately orthogonal, since the Frobenius norm contains terms
 that drive the factors towards orthogonality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three previously identified issues arise with the above:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The hard-clustering assignment of a word to only a single word-class prevents
 words from having multiple meanings, and thus forces word-sense disambiguation
 to somehow happen somewhere else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 As discussed previously, rotational invariance (and thus, orthogonality)
 is inappropriate when 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$

 are interpreted as joint probability distributions.

\begin_layout Itemize

Factorization Ambiguity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When considering the factorization of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:factorize"

\end_inset

, the sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{g\in G}$
\end_inset

 can be seen as a specific function, 
\emph on
viz
\emph default
, the inner product of two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\vec{w}\right)_{g}=p\left(w|g\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\vec{d}\right)_{g}=p\left(g,d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Aside from considering just the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\vec{w},\vec{d}\right)=\vec{w}\cdot\vec{d}$
\end_inset

, one might consider other functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\vec{w},\vec{d}\right)$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{w}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{d}$
\end_inset

.
 For example, a single-layer feed-forward linear neural net would consist
 of a 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G\right|\times\left|G\right|$
\end_inset

-dimensional weight matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(\vec{w},\vec{d}\right)=\vec{w}^{T}\cdot M\cdot\vec{d}
\]

\end_inset

This, in itself, because it is linear, does not accomplish much, because
 the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 can be re-composed on the left or the right, to re-define the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{w}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{d}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, one may write 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{w}^{\prime}=M^{T}\vec{w}$
\end_inset

 to get a different product 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{w}^{\prime}\cdot\vec{d}$
\end_inset

, or, alternately 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{d}^{\prime}=M\vec{d}$
\end_inset

 for a product 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{w}\cdot\vec{d}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 The dot-product in the factorization is ambiguous; the point is that the
 factorization of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:factorize"

\end_inset

 is not unique.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The low-rank matrix-factorization literature expresses this idea by noting
 that a dot-product is invariant under orthogonal rotations, and so one
 can choose an arbitrary orthogonal matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $O^{T}O=I$
\end_inset

 and write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{w}\cdot\vec{d}=\left(\vec{w}O^{T}\right)\cdot\left(O\vec{d}\right)=\vec{w}^{\prime}\cdot\vec{d}^{\prime}
\]

\end_inset

Since the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{d}$
\end_inset

 are naturally probabilities, the above is exactly what we do 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 what to do! As already noted, orthogonal rotations applied to a probability
 turn it into something that is not a probability.
 Instead, we want to stick to a single (ambiguous) matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 that is Markovian, so that, when contracted to the left or to the right,
 the resulting vectors are still probabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This becomes more clear if written in in components:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w,d\right)=\sum_{g}\sum_{g^{\prime}}p\left(w|g\right)M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)
\]

\end_inset

This shows that the factorization is ambiguous; as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is Markovian, preserving the sums of probabilities over rows and columns,
 it can be contracted to the left or the right.
 Indeed: 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 itself can be factored into an arbitrary product of Markovian matrices,
 which can then be merged to the left and right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, to get a meaningful factorization, one can must introduce additional
 constraints.
 A seemingly natural one, to be developed later, is to choose 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)$
\end_inset

 are both maximally sparse.
 One would like to assign a word to at most a handful of different word-classes,
 corresponding to the synonym classes for each word-sense attached to that
 word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A quick review of the concept of a Markovian matrix is in order.
 A matrix can be Markovian on the left side, the right side, or both.
 It is Markovian on the right if 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1=\sum_{g}M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)\mbox{ for all }g^{\prime}
\]

\end_inset

This assures that a transformed joint probability 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p^{\prime}\left(g,d\right)=\sum_{g^{\prime}}M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)
\]

\end_inset

is still a valid joint probability distribution; namely, that 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\prime}\left(*,*\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one has such a factorization, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)$
\end_inset

 are maximally sparse, then the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 will likely be very highly connected, i.e.
 will have many or most of its matrix entries be non-zero.
 Conceptually, one can visualize the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 as a highly connected graph, while the factors 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)$
\end_inset

 are low-density feeder tree-branches that connect into this tightly-coupled
 central component.

This figure attempts to illustrate the process of factorization.
 The left-most image is meant to illustrate

\end_inset

 as a sparse matrix.
 Edges indicate those values where 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 is not zero.
 Not every 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is connected to every 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

 is confused and tangled.
 The middle image is meant to illustrate the factorization 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{g}p\left(w,g\right)p\left(g,d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In this factorization, the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

 not only becomes more sparse, but has a very low out-degree for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

: only one or a handful of entries in 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

 are non-zero for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 The rightmost image attempts to illustrate the factorization 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{g,g^{\prime}}p\left(w,g\right)M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Here, the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)$
\end_inset

 has low in-degree for any fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 All of the tangle and interconnectedness has been factored out into the
 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 connecting word-classes to disjunct-classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In hard-clustering, these low-degree requirements are automatically satisfied:
 a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 can belong to only one word-cluster 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, and so there is only one line in the figure connecting 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 to anything.
 Likewise, a disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 can only be assigned to one cluster 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 Due to the fact that words are combinations of word-senses, hard-clustering
 in this fashion is undesirable; by contrast, it seems that word-senses
 could be validly hard-clustered.

\begin_layout Standard
In the above factorization, matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 was made explicitly Markovian, so as to preserve the left and right factors
 as joint probabilities.
 However, it seems to be particularly important to the semantic structure
 of the language: it captures the complexity of language, whereas the left
 and right factors merely funnel spelled-out word-strings into the actual
 semantic categories.
 Thus, it is convenient to instead write the left and write factors as Markov
 matrices, while taking the central factor to be a joint probability.
 This can be achieved by factoring as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p\left(w,d\right)=\sum_{g}\sum_{g^{\prime}}p\left(w|g\right)p\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)p\left(d|g^{\prime}\right)\label{eq:central-decomposition}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the left and right factors are conditional probabilities.
 That is,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w|g\right)=\frac{p\left(w,g\right)}{p\left(*,g\right)}
\]

\end_inset

and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(d|g^{\prime}\right)=p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)/p\left(g^{\prime},*\right)$
\end_inset

.
 These are explicitly Markovian, in that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{g}p\left(w|g\right)=1
\]

\end_inset

and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{g^{\prime}}p\left(d|g^{\prime}\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 This factorization is just a rescaling of the earlier factorization: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)=p\left(*,g\right)M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)p\left(g^{\prime},*\right)
\]

\end_inset

and is done so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 can be seen as a joint probability: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{g,g^{\prime}}p\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)=1
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ambiguity of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is removed, if one assumes hard clustering.
 In this case, each 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 can belong to only one 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, and each 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 to just one 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, and, once the clusters are chosen, there is no confusion about the left
 and right factors, and thus, the central factor is fixed.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In physics, such an ambiguity of factorization is known as a global gauge
 symmetry; fixing a gauge removes the ambiguity.
 In natural language, the ambiguity is spontaneously broken: words have
 only a few senses, and are often sysnonymous, making the left and right
 factors sparse.
 For this reason, the analogy to physics is entertaining but mostly pointless.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A factorization of this sort is known as co-clustering, bi-clustering or
 sometimes block clustering.
 An explicit development of this, including an explicit iterative algorithm
 guaranteed to converge, is given by Dhillon et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dhillon2003"

\end_inset

 and is reviewed in a subsection below.
 Of course, for natural language, we want to decompose words into word-senses,
 and so naive hard-clustering will not work.
 It does, however, illuminate the path ahead.

Factorization in Link Grammar

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This factorization is 
\emph on
de facto
\emph default
 observed in the hand-built dictionaries for Link Grammar.
 Examination of the 
\family typewriter
4.0.dict
\family default
 file in the Link Grammar file distribution will clearly show how words
 are grouped into word-classes.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
words.n.2.s
\family default
 is a list of plural count-nouns.
 The Link Grammar costs are very rough approximations for the log probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log p$
\end_inset

, and so the contents of 
\family typewriter
words.n.2.s
\family default
 is effectively a representation of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $g=\left\langle \mbox{plural-count-nouns}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and a uniform probability across this class.
 The file 
\family typewriter
4.0.dict
\family default
 also defines a large number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

macros
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, with names such as 
\family typewriter
<noun-main-p>
\family default
.
 These macros are stand-ins for lists of disjuncts, often given equal weight,
 but also not uncommonly assigned different costs.
 In essence, 
\family typewriter
<noun-main-p>
\family default
 should be understood as an example of 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\prime}=\mbox{\left\langle noun\negthinspace-\negthinspace main\negthinspace-\negthinspace p\right\rangle }$
\end_inset

.
 It appears multiple times throughout the file.
 In one case, it is associated with the word-list 
\family typewriter
words.n.2.s
\family default
, which makes sense, as 
\family typewriter
<noun-main-p>
\family default
 is describing one of the linkage behaviors of plural common nouns.
 The contents of the file 
\family typewriter
4.0.dict
\family default
 should be understood to be a specification of 
\begin_inset Formula $M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

, although it is not so cleanly organized: it also includes all of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

macros
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)$
\end_inset

 and also includes word-lists when these are small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more careful examination of the use of the macros in 
\family typewriter
4.0.dict
\family default
 shows that these are often cascaded into one-another.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
<noun-main-s>
\family default
 is used in the definition of 
\family typewriter
<proper-names>,
\family default
 
\family typewriter
<entity-entire>
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
<common-noun>
\family default
, each of which service word classes that are similar and yet differ syntactical
ly and semantically.
 This is not just some strange artifact of hand-building a dictionary encoding
 grammar.
 It is 
\emph on
prima facie
\emph default
 evidence of important substructures inside of 
\begin_inset Formula $M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

, essentially pointing at the idea that 
\begin_inset Formula $M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 can be further factored into smaller, tightly-connected blocks; 
\emph on
viz
\emph default
., that the graph of 
\begin_inset Formula $M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 contains strongly-coupled bipartite cliques.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This explicit co-clustering in Link Grammar is not driven by any sort of
 theoretical arguments or foundation.
 Rather, it is a natural, intuitive outcome of how the linguists who author
 the dictionaries wish to tackle the problem.
 A good factorization saves time and effort for the author, and is easier
 to debug.
 The urge to factorize is not limited to English: a look at any of the dictionar
ies shows this structure clearly.
 It becomes even more pronounced in dictionaries with morphology, e.g.
 in the Russian dictionaries, where word-stems (which carry most of the
 meaning) are factored away from the suffixes (which provide the needed
 tense, gender, number and person agreement across sentences).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Tensor Product Factorization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea that 
\begin_inset Formula $M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 contains important substructures is important enough to point out a second
 time.
 Based on explicit experience with Link Grammar, those substructures are
 likely to require a tensor product factorization (as opposed to a matrix
 product factorization) to make sense of them.
 Its possible to speculate that a Tucker factorization may provide a reasonable
 first approximation to this factorization.
 Nothing further on this can be said at this point, until a reliable way
 to obtain a stable, reproducible and accurate 
\begin_inset Formula $M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 is in hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Rank and Dimension
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the example of the actual English lexis in Link Grammar, there
 is no need to assume that the number of word classes 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G\right|$
\end_inset

 should somehow be equal to the number of syntactic usage patterns 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G^{\prime}\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, the dimension of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 has to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G\right|\times\left|G^{\prime}\right|$
\end_inset

; but these two dimensions are not known from any 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 principles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More careful vocabulary is needed here: one can say that 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $\left|G\right|$
\end_inset

 
\emph default
is the number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word classes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The number of of syntactic usage patterns 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G^{\prime}\right|$
\end_inset

 could be called the number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

grammatical classes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, although historic usage conflates these two terms.
 Thus, the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

syntactic classes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 seems the most appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of word classes 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $\left|G\right|$
\end_inset

 
\emph default
must surely be fairly high, as they must capture not only the predicate-argument
 structure,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WP-Predicate,WP-Argument"

\end_inset

 but the resulting syntax constraints must force the selection of the predicate-
argument structure.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WP-Selection"

\end_inset

 Roughly speaking, the number of word classes should correspond to the number
 of different synonym classes one might expect to find.
 This is confused by the situation of common nouns: there are vast numbers
 of these, and while most are not synonyms, most are syntactically interchangeab
le, even when forcing predicate-argument agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The appropriate number of syntactic classes 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G^{\prime}\right|$
\end_inset

 is presumably a lot lower.
 At a minimum, it corresponds to the number of classical head-phrase structure
 grammar non-terminals, such as 
\family sans
S, NP, VP, PP, D, A, V, N,
\family default
 
\emph on
etc
\emph default
.
 A more complete set can be found in the dependency grammar relations 
\family sans
subj, obj, iobj, det, amod, advmod, psubj, pobj,
\family default
 
\emph on
etc
\emph default
.
 but even this seems too low.
 There are just over 100 different link types in Link Grammar, growing to
 the thousands, when one considers various subtypes (subscripts).
 However, the number of distinct macros in the English lexis provides a
 different lower bound.
 At any rate, the size of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G^{\prime}\right|$
\end_inset

 cannot be smaller than 100 for a realistic model of the English language,
 and an accurate model is likely to require 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G^{\prime}\right|$
\end_inset

 of at least a few thousand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Akaike Information Criterion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How many word classes and syntactic classes should there be? Aside from
 making various 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 guesses, one can apply the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
 Essentially, the grammatical classes can be taken as the parameters of
 the model.
 The AIC can be used as a guide to determine how many of them are required.
 This is easy to say in principle; a computationally efficient mechanism
 is not yet clear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Removing Ambiguity in Factorization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted in the earlier subsection, the ambiguity in the factorization can
 be removed by hard clustering.
 Practical experience with hands-on similarity measures in language data
 indicate that there should not be much of a problem: most words that are
 similar are obviously-so, using an appropriate pair-wise similarity function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose this was not easily the case? To guide the factorization, and to
 maximize the sparsity of the left and the right factors, while maximizing
 the complexity of the central factor, one can appeal to Tegmark's formulation
 of Tononi integrated information as a guide.
 That is, one wishes to factorize in such a way that the total amount of
 integrated information in the left and right factors are minimized, while
 the integrated information of the central factor is maximized.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In essence, factorization is a reorganization of the graph so as to always
 maximize the integrated information of an important central core.
 All edges where mutual information is weak are to be pruned away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Information Loss
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the factorization is to minimize the information loss between
 the input data and the factorization.
 The objective function is then The Kullback-Leibler divergence, a minor
 variant on the previous eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:KL-MI-factorization-loss"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
MI_{Loss}=\sum_{w,d}p\left(w,d\right)\log_{2}\frac{p\left(w,d\right)}{\sum_{g\in G}\sum_{g^{\prime}\in G^{\prime}}p\left(w|g\right)p\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)p\left(d|g^{\prime}\right)}\label{eq:full-factor-loss}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

By minimizing this divergence, one minimizes the total loss incurred by
 the factorization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above information loss estimate is identical to that described by Dhillon
 
\emph on
et al
\emph default
.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dhillon2003"

\end_inset

 in their treatment of hard co-clustering.
 That reference provides an extensive and detailed review of the factorization
 problem being addressed in this section, with the exception that the current
 need for word-sense disambiguation violates their hard-clustering assumption.
 Words cannot be hard-clustered; word-vectors must be decomposed into word-sense
 vectors first.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vepstas2018stiching"

\end_inset

 Nonetheless, many formulas are still relevant, and the reference gives
 detailed motivation for them, and provides multiple articulations and derivatio
ns.
 Various results are recapped here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the special case of hard clustering, where each word or disjunct is
 assigned to only one word class/grammatical class, one has that (eqn (6)
 of Dhillon)
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)=\sum_{w\in g}\sum_{d\in g^{\prime}}p\left(w,d\right)\label{eq:central factor}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

From this, it follows that (eqn (4) of Dhillion)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{Loss}=MI\left(W,D\right)-MI\left(G,G^{\prime}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and so eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:full-factor-loss"

\end_inset

 really is the information loss from factorization.
 For hard clustering, the loss can be written in terms of only the left,
 or the right clusters, so that (lemma 4.1 of Dhillon)
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
MI_{Loss} & = & \sum_{g}\sum_{w\in g}p\left(w,*\right)\sum_{d}p\left(d|w\right)\log_{2}\frac{p\left(d|w\right)}{p\left(d|g\right)}\\
 & = & \sum_{g}\sum_{w\in g}\sum_{d}p\left(w,d\right)\log_{2}\frac{p\left(w,d\right)}{p\left(w,*\right)}\,\frac{p\left(g,*\right)}{p\left(g,d\right)}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

This allows an iterative algorithm to be performed, clustering only rows
 (or only columns), that is, only words (or only disjuncts).

 It is an iterative hill-climbing algorithm, alternating between three steps:
 the computation of marginals, and the assignment of new row clusters, and
 the assignment of new column clusters.
 The marginals are recomputed after every reclustering.
 Dhillon provides a proof that, for hard clustering, the information loss
 is monotonically decreasing; viz, that iteration always moves to a better
 solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given provisional cluster assignments 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, so that every word and every disjuncts can be placed into some specific
 cluster, all three factors 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)$
\end_inset

 are available (are computable) given the cluster assignments.
 The central factor is given by eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:central factor"

\end_inset

.
 The left and right factors are obtained as marginals:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w,g\right)=\begin{cases}
p\left(w,*\right) & \mbox{ if }w\in g\\
0 & \mbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)=\begin{cases}
p\left(*,d\right) & \mbox{ if }d\in g^{\prime}\\
0 & \mbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

The above are always known and well-defined, since, by assumption, the provision
al cluster assignments 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 are known at each step of the iteration.
 The conditional probabilities are as noted before: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w|g\right)=\frac{p\left(w,g\right)}{p\left(*,g\right)}
\]

\end_inset

 and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(d|g^{\prime}\right)=\frac{p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)}{p\left(g^{\prime},*\right)}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(*,g\right)=\sum_{w\in g}p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(g^{\prime},*\right)=\sum_{d\in g^{\prime}}p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The new cluster assignments are obtained by minimizing the information loss,
 once for the rows, and once for the columns.
 In one step, one searches for cluster assignments 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in g$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{word\,loss}=\sum_{d}p\left(d|w\right)\log_{2}\frac{p\left(d|w\right)}{p\left(d|g^{\prime}\right)p\left(g^{\prime}|g\right)}
\]

\end_inset

is minimized.
 After recomputing marginals, one then reclusters the disjuncts, by searching
 for the clustering 
\begin_inset Formula $d\in g^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 that minimizes the loss 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{disjunct\,loss}=\sum_{w}p\left(w|d\right)\log_{2}\frac{p\left(w|d\right)}{p\left(w|g\right)p\left(g|g^{\prime}\right)}
\]

\end_inset

This looks like an entirely reasonable algorithm, concrete and specific
 and implementable, until one refers back to the table in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Sparsity"

\end_inset

.
 There are in excess of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{5}$
\end_inset

 words to provisionally assign to clusters, and 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{7}$
\end_inset

 or more disjuncts.
 Each provisional clustering requires extensive re-computation of marginal
 probabilities.
 Exhaustive search for the best clustering clearly cannot scale to the current
 datasets.
 One might be able to make some forward progress by means of genetic algorithms,
 as one is performing hill-climbing on a well-defined utility function.
 The hard cluster membership can be encoded as a very long bit-string: this
 is exactly the scenario for which genetic algorithms were designed to solve:
 optimizing large bit strings, given a utility function on them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But never mind: the assumption of hard clustering breaks word-sense disambiguati
on.
 Genetic algorithms are not enough.
 Back to the drawing board.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Word-Sense Disambiguation
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Word-Sense-Disambiguation"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary issue with hard clustering is that it fails to correctly disentangle
 different word senses.
 There is an opportunity to do better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A prototype example is given by the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

saw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It could be the noun, referring to the cutting tool; it could be the verb
 synonymous to cutting; it could be the past tense of the verb 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

to see
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The observational data consists of occurrence counts 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(\mbox{"saw"},d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The goal of word-sense disambiguation is to somehow factor this into three
 grammatical classes 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N\left(\mbox{"saw"},d\right)=N\left(\left\langle \mbox{tool}\right\rangle ,d\right)+N\left(\left\langle \mbox{cutting}\right\rangle ,d\right)+N\left(\left\langle \mbox{seeing}\right\rangle ,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

The general problem of how to accomplish this, and several tactics are discussed
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vepstas2018stiching"

\end_inset

.
 That presentation focuses on cosine distances.
 This section provides an information-theoretic variant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The actual observed frequencies 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 are, by definition, sums of word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 used with every different possible word-sense 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{k}$
\end_inset

 that the word could have.
 That is, explicitly, one has that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w,d\right)=\sum_{k}p\left(s_{k},d\right)
\]

\end_inset

In poetry and in word-play, a word might be used in such a way that multiple
 senses are simultaneously applied.
 The assumption above is that this is not the case: that the text assigns
 only a single meaning to each word use.
 In any given use, the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

saw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is either a noun, or one of the verbs; it cannot be some mixture of all
 of them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each word-sense can then be hard-clustered into a single grammatical category:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

saw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

-the-noun belongs to just one grammatical category, the one that holds synonyms
 for cutting tools.
 Thus, the hard-clustering formula applies:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(s,g\right)=\begin{cases}
p\left(s,*\right) & \mbox{ if }s\in g\\
0 & \mbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

The intent of the sense label 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is that it is uniquely associated with just one word, and no others.
 The number of word-senses is strictly larger than the vocabulary: every
 vocabulary word has at least one sense.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(*,s\right)=p\left(w,s\right)$
\end_inset

 holds for all 
\begin_inset Formula $s\in w$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the conditional probability is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w|s\right)=\frac{p\left(w,s\right)}{p\left(*,s\right)}=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{ if }s\in w\\
0 & \mbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

The decomposition of words into senses is then (restating the earlier formula
 in slightly different notation: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
p\left(w,d\right) & = & \sum_{s}p\left(w|s\right)p\left(s,d\right)\\
 & = & \sum_{s\in w}p\left(s,d\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

To be consistent with the central factorization 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:central-decomposition"

\end_inset

, one must have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{s\in w}p\left(s,g\right)=p\left(w,g\right)
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{s\in w}p\left(s|g\right)=p\left(w|g\right)
\]

\end_inset

Since a word-sense is associated with just one word, the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{s\in w}$
\end_inset

 is superfluous: one can unambiguously write 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{s}$
\end_inset

 as all other entries are zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central factorization now has the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(w,d\right)=\sum_{s}p\left(s,d\right)=\sum_{s}\sum_{g}\sum_{g^{\prime}}p\left(s|g\right)p\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)p\left(d|g^{\prime}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Not much has changed: the word-senses can now be legitimately hard-clustered;
 but the decomposition of words into word-senses is unknown.
 The clustering algorithm reviewed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Biclustering"

\end_inset

 is very nearly unaffected: one replaces the provisional clustering guesses
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in g$
\end_inset

 by provisional guesses 
\begin_inset Formula $s\in w$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s\in g$
\end_inset

.
 The feasibility of the algorithm is further challenged by the fact that
 there are more word-senses than there are words, further increasing the
 computational space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Graph Algorithms vs.
 Gradient Descent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous section, the Word2Vec style algorithms were characterized
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gradient descent algorithms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and were contrasted with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

graph algorithms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that explicitly and overtly focus on the graphical relationships between
 items.
 The same contrast can be made here: clustering is a form of a graph algorithm,
 whereas the matrix factorization algorithms are all driven by a form of
 gradient descent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difference can be highlighted by noticing that cluster assignment is
 essentially a form of greedy algorithm: One looks for the best-fitting
 cluster, and accepts that first, effectively ignoring all of the other
 clusters.
 The relationship of word-to-cluster is explicit and overt; by contrast,
 the matrix factorization is only implicit: a cluster relationship exists
 whenever a matrix element is large.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current state of the art, the gradient-descent algorithms tend to
 outperform the clustering algorithms, when the size of hidden layers is
 limited to a computationally tractable size.
 This can be interpreted in several ways: for small hidden layers, the clusterin
g algos just might be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too greedy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, applying too strong a discrimination.
 Gradient descent algorithms also organize compute cycles differently, removing
 certain repeated calculations out of a tight loop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One advantage of the clustering approach is that, since it makes the graph
 structure explicit, it provides a mechanism for controlling the shape of
 the graph.
 Another is that it seems to perhaps be more scalable, when the size of
 the hidden layers are not suitably small.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Control of Graphical Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the matrix factorization, illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Factorization"

\end_inset

, is to not only obtain the three factors 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(g^{\prime},d\right)$
\end_inset

, but to obtain them such that the first and last components contain essentially
 no bipartite cliques, and all of the structural complexity is limited to
 
\begin_inset Formula $M\left(g,g^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 A naive gradient descent does not seem to achieve this; it will provide
 numerical values, but will not go out of its way to maximally set as many
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,g\right)$
\end_inset

 values to zero as possible.
 In keeping with the general trend: the goal here is to set as many matrix
 entries to zero as possible, thereby getting the greatest amount of data
 compression as possible.
 Yet, fidelity has to be maintained: just the right entries should be non-zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point here is that it is the graph structure that is the most important;
 the actual numerical values associated with each edge are far less important.
 They are nice, and useful for improving accuracy and parse ranking, but
 provide little insight in and of themselves.
 The graph structure dominates.
 This is made clear in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Factorization-in-Link"

\end_inset

, where a huge amount of progress can be made by means of manual factorization,
 and setting all edge weights to essentially just one value: present or
 absent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Greedy clustering essentially provides a mechanism for controlling this
 structure: it inherently limits the number of grammatical classes that
 a word can belong to.
 It dis-incentivizes the partitioning of a word into a large number of grammatic
al categories.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Factorizing the language model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above developments now provide enough background to clearly state the
 problem.
 Inspired by the factorization of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:factorize"

\end_inset

, one wishes to find a collection of word classes, assigning words to a
 handful of classes, according to the in-context word-sense.
 The proper factorization needs to be of the form of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:central-decomposition"

\end_inset

, as illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Factorization"

\end_inset

.
 The appropriate measure of quality is to minimize the information loss
 in the factorization, as given by eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:full-factor-loss"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More precisely, the factorization of the language model appears to require
 three important ingredients:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A way of decomposing word-vectors into sums of word-sense vectors,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A way of performing biclustering, so as to split the bipartite graph 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 into left, central and right components, holding the left and right parts
 to be sparse,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Using an information-theoretic similarity metric, to preserve the probabilistic
 interpretation of the contingency table 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Combining all these parts in one go is daunting.
 Smaller steps towards the ultimate goal can be taken.
 One easy first step is to perform clustering using an information metric,
 instead of the cosine distance.
 This is done in the section below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second step is to replace hard clustering by an algorithm that treats
 word-vectors as sums of (as yet unknown) distinct word senses.
 Because this is a substantial topic in itself, this is handled in a distinct
 tract; see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Subsection
Information-theoretic Clustering

\begin_layout Standard
The previous section uses the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

information theoretic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clustering
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in close proximity.
 This is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and so a lighting review of the literature is warranted.
 Two observations pop out:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
None of the systems described in the literature assume that the input data
 can already be interpreted as a probability; rather, the clustering is
 being performed on data naturally occurring in some Euclidean space, typically,
 some space of low dimension (e.g.
 two-dimensional image data).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Most approaches to information-theoretic clustering use the mutual information
 between members of a cluster and the cluster label.
 Unfortunately, this has an ambiguity: the information content is conserved
 by any Markov matrix that reassigns the cluster labels, so, for example,
 a permutation matrix that just shuffles the cluster labels.
 Ver Steeg

et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset


\emph default
 propose a solution to this ambiguity: a return to first principles, requiring
 that information loss due to coarse-graining be minimized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several other notable points are discussed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Renyi Information Divergence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gokcay and Principe
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gokcay2002"

\end_inset

 propose the Renyi entropy as an information divergence.
 It is essentially minus the logarithm of the cosine metric.
 Given two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

, the information divergence is defined as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{CEF}\left(\vec{u},\vec{v}\right)=-\log\cos\left(\vec{u},\vec{v}\right)=-\log\hat{u}\cdot\hat{v}=-\log\frac{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}}{\left\Vert \vec{u}\right\Vert \left\Vert \vec{v}\right\Vert }
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \cdot\right\Vert $
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{2}$
\end_inset

-norm.
 Although this is widely cited in the literature pertaining to information-theor
etic clustering, there is no particular reason to believe that it offers
 any advantage at all over the ordinary cosine metric, when applied to the
 task of clustering grammatical categories.
 In particular, it suffers from the same defects previously identified:
 it contains an inbuilt assumption that the data presents in a Euclidean,
 rotationally symmetric space, which is very much not the case for the language
 data.
 The vectors of in the contingency table that the language data is organized
 in are not Euclidean vectors: they are joint probabilities.
 They transform not under orthogonal rotations, but under Markov matrices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also some practical, language-related reasons to lose interest
 in the above information divergence: When examining actual language data,
 as is done in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vepstas2017connectors"

\end_inset

, it becomes quite clear that there is a practical, common-sense cutoff
 for similarlity.
 If two words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}$
\end_inset

 have a similarity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\left(w_{1},w_{2}\right)\lesssim0.5$
\end_inset

, they are very nearly unrelated; for a similarity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\left(w_{1},w_{2}\right)\lesssim0.1$
\end_inset

, they are fantastically unrelated.
 It would be crazy to assign anything with such low similarities to a common
 cluster.
 Extending the notion of similarity to truly wee values, as the logarithm
 enables, is meaningless.
 For cosine values greater than 1/2, the logarithm is essentially linear:
 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log\cos\,x\approx1-\cos\,x$
\end_inset

 in the region of interest.
 The appearance of the logarithm does nothing to advance the situation.

 revert to first principles, and propose that the information divergence
 should be approximately invariant under the coarse-graining of the input
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is some appeal in this idea for the language problem: a large cluster
 of approximate synonyms should be factorizable into smaller clusters of
 more tightly-related synonyms.
 Conversely, one should be able to consolidate small blocks into bigger
 ones, with a minimum of information loss.
 However, based on the explorations in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

, this does not appear to be a problem that needs to be externally forced
 onto the system.
 Pair-wise word similarities seem to be of high quality; it would take some
 work to have this wrecked by the clustering algorithm.
 Still ...
 additional consideration might be warranted.

 This section generalizes to an information metric, as opposed to the usual

 The second subsection presents the information metric.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Cosine clustering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The usual metric for judging similarity is the cosine metric: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\cos\left(\vec{u},\vec{v}\right)=\hat{u}\cdot\hat{v}=\frac{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}}{\left\Vert \vec{u}\right\Vert \left\Vert \vec{v}\right\Vert }
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \cdot\right\Vert $
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{2}$
\end_inset

-norm.
 If the input data is taken as a collection of (row) vectors, then the input
 can be viewed as a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\left[\vec{v}_{1},\vec{v}_{2},\cdots,\vec{v}_{n}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The product matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $S=XX^{T}$
\end_inset

 then has matrix entries 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{ij}=\vec{v}_{i}\cdot\vec{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 If the vectors are already normalized, then the matrix entries 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{ij}$
\end_inset

 are just the cosine distances between 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 This is used to accomplish 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-means clustering by finding a 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times k$
\end_inset

 matrix membership indicator matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 such that the objective function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=\mbox{tr}F^{T}SF
\]

\end_inset

is minimized.
 Some basic algebra (again, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ding2005"

\end_inset

) shows that this is equivalent to minimizing the Frobenius norm 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=\left\Vert X-FF^{T}\right\Vert ^{2}
\]

\end_inset

which in turn is identical to minimizing the distance between cluster centroids
 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{m}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and each member 
\begin_inset Formula $j\in C_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

'th cluster.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j\in C_{i}}\left\Vert \vec{v}_{j}-\vec{m}_{i}\right\Vert ^{2}
\]

\end_inset

The centroid 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{m}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the arithmetic mean of all of the vectors in the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

'th cluster:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{m}_{i}=\frac{1}{\left|C_{i}\right|}\sum_{j\in C_{i}}\vec{v}_{j}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|C_{i}\right|$
\end_inset

 is the number of members in the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

'th cluster.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pair-wise Information Divergence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cosine was built from the dot product 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 normalized by the vector lengths.
 For information-based clustering, the normalization is changed, so as to
 use the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the vector-pair, and the individual
 vectors: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI\left(\vec{u},\vec{v}\right)=\log_{2}\frac{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\vec{v}_{i}\cdot\vec{v}_{j}\right)}{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v_{i}}\right)\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n}\vec{v}_{j}\cdot\vec{v}\right)}
\]

\end_inset

This unusual-looking expression can be made more recognizable by changing
 notation back to the joint probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 of observing word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 with disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

\begin_inset Formula $w$

\begin_inset Formula $S_{ij}=\vec{v}_{i}\cdot\vec{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 in the equivalent form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S\left(w_{1},w_{2}\right)=\sum_{d}p\left(w_{1},d\right)p\left(w_{2},d\right)
\]

\end_inset

The information divergence 
\begin_inset Formula $MI\left(\vec{u},\vec{v}\right)$
\end_inset

 is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI\left(w_{1},w_{2}\right)=\log_{2}\frac{S\left(w_{1},w_{2}\right)S\left(*,*\right)}{S\left(w_{1},*\right)S\left(*,w_{2}\right)}
\]

\end_inset

where, as always, the stars 
\begin_inset Formula $*$
\end_inset

 denote the wild-card sums: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S\left(w_{1},*\right)=\sum_{w_{2}}S\left(w_{1},w_{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

By normalizing, one gets an expression that looks just like a joint probability:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q\left(w_{1},w_{2}\right)=\frac{S\left(w_{1},w_{2}\right)}{S\left(*,*\right)}
\]

\end_inset

with
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
MI\left(w_{1},w_{2}\right)=\log_{2}\frac{Q\left(w_{1},w_{2}\right)}{Q\left(w_{1},*\right)Q\left(*,w_{2}\right)}\label{eq:pairwise-info-divergence}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Intuitively.
 this can be thought of the information gain of bringing two vectors together,
 as compared to the entire dataset of all other vectors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This global aspect makes this function very different from the cosine distance.
 The cosine distance is defined independently of all other vectors in the
 system; it is independent of the number of other vectors, and the directions
 in which they are pointing.
 On could have a system with 42 vectors, or with 23 thousand of them: the
 cosine metric doesn't care.
 One could have a system with two vectors pointing one way, and another
 six hundred pointing in the opposite direction: cosine doesn't care.
 The pair-wise MI above compares two vectors, within the context of what
 all of the other vectors in the system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A different way to think of the pair-wise MI is that, by incorporating all
 other vectors into its value, it is effectively attempting to spread all
 of the (other) vectors into as uniform distribution as possible, magnifying
 and expanding those regions where cosine would say there are lots of densely
 packed vectors, while shrinking those regions where there is low density.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way the above can be visualized is to consider two vectors, roughly
 collinear, and another six hundred, also all roughly collinear, but almost
 orthogonal to the first two.
 Consider then the MI values for different pairs chosen from this collection.
 Two vectors which might have the same cosine angle will have very different
 MI values, in this kind of dataset.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Scale invariance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information divergence 
\begin_inset Formula $MI\left(w_{1},w_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 is scale invariant: replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $kp\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 for some constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 does not alter the divergence.
 In particular, replacing the joint probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 by the conditional probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(d|w\right)=p\left(w,d\right)/p\left(w,*\right)$
\end_inset

 does not alter the information divergence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Arithmetic and Geometric Means
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For vectors obtained from natural language, there is good reason to believe
 that the natural clusters are convex, rather than being oddly shaped.
 Therefore, it is meaningful to ask about and talk about the centroid of
 a cluster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a Euclidean space, possessing rotational invariance and some notion
 of uniform distribution, the arithmetic mean of the vectors in a cluster
 would be a natural choice for the centroid.
 However, as is being repeatedly noted, vectors taken from a joint probability
 distribution do not live in a Euclidean, rotationally symmetric space.
 The arithmetic mean does not make sense.
 There are several candidates that are more suitable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One is the geometric mean.
 The centroid for word-cluster 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 might be expressed by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m\left(g,d\right)=\sqrt[\frac{1}{\left|g\right|}]{\prod_{w\in g}p\left(w,d\right)}
\]

\end_inset

This has the peculiar property that, if for any word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 in the cluster, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)=0$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $m\left(g,d\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 The support for the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $m\left(g,d\right)$
\end_inset

 is the intersection of the supports for the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In itself, this is not terribly objectionable or bad, but for one thing:
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 are observational frequencies, and are not theoretical distributions.
 Thus, one might have that 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)=0$
\end_inset

 simply because it has not been observed, and not because it is grammatically
 forbidden.
 This was already noted in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Sparsity"

\end_inset

: contingency tables fundamentally cannot distinguish between rare linguistic
 phenomena and grammatically forbidden phenomena.
 The Zipfian distribution prohibits this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can imagine several work-arounds.
 One would be to apply some form of kernel smoothing, or to apply some sort
 of local regression.
 How this might work is unclear.
 Consider instead the logarithm of the geometric mean:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\log_{2}m\left(g,d\right)=\frac{1}{\left|g\right|}\sum_{w\in g}\log_{2}p\left(w,d\right)\label{eq:cluster mean}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To be consistent with the previous expression, if 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 has not been observed, one should take 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}p\left(w,d\right)=-\infty$
\end_inset

.
 From the missing-data perspective, it would actually be better to take
 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}p\left(w,d\right)=0$
\end_inset

 – missing observations contribute nothing.
 Continuing in this vein of thinking, that infrequently-observed phenomena
 are being unfairly punished and are not being given due weight, one might
 consider the centroid to be described by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\log_{2}m_{\alpha}\left(g,d\right)=\frac{1}{\left|g\right|}\sum_{w\in g}\left(\log_{2}p\left(w,d\right)\right)^{\alpha}
\]

\end_inset

for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\le1$
\end_inset

, thus effectively making rare phenomena seem less rare, while common phenomena
 become less common.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An intuitive feel for the geometric mean can be argued: probabilities can
 only be added if they are truly independent, and here they are not; but
 probabilities, taken as discrete events, can always be multiplied.
 For a a probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(X\right)$
\end_inset

 on a space 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, the frequentist interpretation of probability is founded on individual
 observations in the sequence space (aka the Cantor space) 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\omega}=X\times X\times\cdots$
\end_inset

 that is the Cartesian product of an infinite number of copies of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 Frequentist probabilities are sigma-measures on the Borel set of cylinder
 sets on the Cantor space.
 Cylinder sets are the elements of the coarse topology on the product space.
 Cylinder sets correspond to the limits of the pushout diagram 
\begin_inset Formula $\centerdot\leftarrow\centerdot\rightarrow\centerdot$
\end_inset

 that defines the Cartesian product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Agglomerative Clustering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary reason to propose a pair-wise information divergence is to enable
 agglomerative clustering.
 The reason for this was made clear earlier: the sheer scale and quantity
 of data makes hill-climbing and gradient descent algorithms untenable.
 The search space is simply too large.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a corollary, the results of hill-climbing or gradient-descent algorithms
 are insufficiently sparse; one wishes to approximate the sparsity that
 hard-clustering offers, with less overhead and complexity in finding the
 clusters.
\end_layout

Word-Sense Disambiguation

\begin_layout Standard
The section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 describes the general, global framework for discussing word-senses in the
 factorization model.
 The challenge of agglomerative clustering is to obtain some estimate of
 word-sense assignments, given as a starting point the pairwise information
 divergence of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:pairwise-info-divergence"

\end_inset

 This is where things start to get truly interesting.

Rada Mihalcea describes a word-sense disambiguation algorithm
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mihalcea2004,Mihalcea2005,Mihalcea2007"

\end_inset

 that fits very naturally with the framework being discussed here.
 However, it requires whole-sentence contexts.
 For each instance 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j}$
\end_inset

 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

'th word in a sentence, one assigns an (unknown) vector of word-senses 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{j},s_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 with the set of possible senses 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{k}$
\end_inset

 given externally, as an 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 set, for example, taken from WordNet.
 In addition, one also assumes an externally provided 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 measure of similarity 
\begin_inset Formula $d\left(s_{k},s_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

 of word-senses; again, this can be provided by WordNet.
 One then considers the full graph clique of all possible word-senses that
 might appear in the sentence, and their relation all other possible word-senses.
 That is, one considers the graph 
\begin_inset Formula $M\left(s_{k},s_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

 with the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 indexes corresponding to word-positions in the sentence; the matrix entries
 are just 
\begin_inset Formula $d\left(s_{k},s_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

 normalized so that 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is a Markov matrix (Markov chain).
 One then solves this chain to find the stationary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 This stationary vector can be interpreted as the desired word-sense assignment
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{j},s_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 of the probability that the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

'th word has the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm readily generalizes to any system that can provide logical
 inference on concepts: one replaces the similarity-distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d\left(s_{k},s_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

 by the likelihood of some particular logical inference performed over the
 sentence.
 Taken over multiple sentences, this can provide anaphora resolution and
 reference resolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary drawback of this algorithm is that the word senses must be externall
y supplied.
 For this project, this is even a fatal drawback: the goal is to infer word-sens
es.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Word-sense Similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume, for a moment, that distinct word senses can be inferred from raw
 text, in an unsupervised fashion.
 That is, assume that a joint probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(s,d\right)$
\end_inset

 can be inferred from the text data.
 It is OK if this probability is of low quality, and generally inaccurate:
 disappointingly inaccurate, even.
 If this probability exceeds pure random chance, then the Mihalcea algorithm
 can be run 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in reverse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, to infer the joint probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(s,s^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 between different senses 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 One does so by assuming that, given the specific words in a specific sentence,
 that the word-senses between them are necessarily highly-related.
 Given that the sentence can be parsed into a string of disjuncts 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, one can use 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(s,d\right)$
\end_inset

 to assign a provisional probability 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 to each word, and then collect observational statistics 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(s,s^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 on a sentence-by-sentence basis, incrementing 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 by one for each observed pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(s,s^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 in a sentence.
 After observing a large number of sentences, one has a (sparse) database
 of sense-pair frequencies 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(s,s^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of doing this is to amplify the signal-to-noise ratio.
 This is in more-or-less complete analogy to the case for word-pairs: given
 a small number of observations, they are noisy and inaccurate.
 Increasing the number of observations causes the noise to cancel out, and
 for a signal to emerge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, one can start doing some intriguing things: one can attempt
 to perform maximum-spanning-tree parses, to determine how one given word-sense
 is related to all other word-senses in a given sentence.
 That is, one repeats the process of extracting disjuncts, but this time,
 the connectors on the disjuncts are not words, but word-senses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason for extracting sense-disjuncts is that they provide the doorway
 to obtaining the

 From there, one can extract the 
\series bold

 structure of a sentence, which provides the natural input into a reasoning
 system based on formal logic.
 That is, one can now begin to assemble logical proofs by inferring sequences
 of deductions applied to sense-disjuncts.
 Or rather, more importantly, once can now start to infer the set of valid
 logical deductions that can be applied, rather than taking different forms
 of logical inference as being given 
\emph on

 To be more blunt: this provides the pathway for inferring the rules of
 Goertzel's PLN, or for inferring the rules Pei Wang's Non-Axiomatic Logic,

 That is,

 In many cases, all but one of the entries in

\begin_inset Formula $\vec{\zeta}_{d}$

 Most of the entries in this vector will likewise be zero.

The previous section begins by stating that, ideally, one wants to wants
 to model the probability

\end_inset

, but due to the apparent computational intractability, one beats a tactical
 retreat to computing 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\mbox{word}\left|\mbox{ context}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

 in the CBOW/SkipGram model, and something analogous in the Link Grammar
 model.
 However, by re-casting the problem in terms of disjuncts, however, one
 can do better.
 Dependency parsing allows one to easily create low-cost, simple computational
 models for 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\mbox{phrase}\left|\mbox{ context}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

 or even 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\mbox{sentence}\left|\mbox{ context}\right.\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This is because disjuncts are compositional: they can be assembled, like
 jigsaw-puzzle pieces, into larger assemblages.
 If this is further enhanced with reference resolution, one has a direct
 path towards a computationally tractable model of 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\mbox{sentence}\left|\mbox{ fulltext}\right.\right)$

 describe this for continuous probabilistic models.
 First, one imagines some continuous, uniform space.
 Example sentences form a training corpus are associated with single points
 in this space: the probability mass is initially located at a collection
 of points.
 One then imagines that generalization consists of smearing out those points
 over an extended volume, thereby assigning non-zero probability weights
 to other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nearby
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentences.
 This suggests that there is a choice as to how this smearing-out is done:
 one can spread the probabilities uniformly, in all 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

directions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or one can preferentially spread probabilities only along certain directions.
 Bengio suggests that higher-quality learning and generalization can be
 achieved by finding and appropriately non-uniform way of smearing the probabili

\begin_layout Standard
This description seems like a useful and harmless way of guiding one's thoughts.
 But it leaves open and vague several undefined concepts: that of the

: is this some topological space, perhaps linear, or something else? That
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

: the presumption (the axiom?) that the space is endowed with a metric that
 measures distances.
 Finally, the concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

direction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or at least, a local tangent manifold at each point of the space.
 It seems reasonable to assert that language lives on a manifold, but then,
 the structure of that manifold needs to be elucidated and demonstrated.
 In particular, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

non-uniform spreading
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of probability weights suggests confusion or inconsistency: Perhaps the
 spreading appears to be non-uniform, because the initial metric assigned
 to the space is incorrect? In geometry, one usually works with normalized
 tangent vectors, so that when one extends them to geodesics, each geodesic
 moves with unit velocity.
 It seems plausible to spread out probability weights the same way: spread
 them uniformly, and adjust the shape of the underlying space so that this
 results in a high-quality language model.
