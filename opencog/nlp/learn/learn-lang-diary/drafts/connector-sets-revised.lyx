\begin_layout Title
Connector Sets (Revised) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepstas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Extract from the language-learning diary, reporting on an initial dataset
 containing connector sets.
 This is a revised (6 August 2017) version of the original 11 May 2017 report.
 It re-analyzes and expands the original analysis on a newer, larger dataset.
 This was motivated in part due to several errors found and fixed in the
 processing pipeline in late June/early July.
 In retrospect, it appears these errors mostly did not affect the earlier
 analysis, as the most significant error was introduced after the inital
 analysis was made.
 None-the-less, it seemed prudent to redo the report.
 Sadly, several months were lost in the confusion, requiring large datasets
 to be discarded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a report on a dataset of disjuncts and connector sets, extracted
 from MST parses of a batch of sentences.
 First, a recap of what these are, then a characterization of the database
 contents, and finally, a report on the grammatical similarity of words
 in the dataset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
The errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original report, dated 7 May 2017, was prepared on a painfully small
 dataset, which also (may have?) incorporated a fatal bug in the disjunct
 code: disjuncts were being assembled incorrectly, due to a reversed sign
 in the MI calculations.
 This bug was eventually uncovered, and so it seemed best to entirely discard
 the initial analysis, and instead repeat it with a newer and larger dataset
 that was correctly assembled.
 The revised analysis was done mostly in July.
 Sadly, the discovery of this bug required that multiple large datasets
 be discarded and reconstructed.
 This caused a month of effort to be lost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simultaneously, there was a lot of confusion about the efficacy of the cosine
 similarity measure.
 Initial work on cosine similarity used a filtered dataset, with the goal
 of filtering to reduce 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the dataset, as well as to manage dataset size.
 It turns out that this filtering also had the undesired side-effect of
 destroying much of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

signal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as well -- it rendered many grammatically unrelated words to be judged
 to be very similar.
 Between the accidental sign reversal, and the excessively strong data cuts,
 it was all very confusing, and has taken another month to recover from
 this -- I'm back to where I was in May, just older and wiser, now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Summary of results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary results reported below are these:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* Most scores and metrics that can be assigned to connector sets give a
 (scale-free) Zipfian ranking distribution, and are thus fairly boring.
 Although there are some oddities here and there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* The greater the average number of observations per disjunct, the more
 grammatically acceptable (accurate) the disjunct seems to be.
 This is good news: it means that the general technique is not generating
 ungrammatical garbage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* Connector sets can be given a mutual information score.
 The distribution for the MI scores appears to be Gaussian (i.e.
 bell curve).
 This comes as a bit of a surprise.
 I am not aware of what kind of network theory gives a natural rise to Gaussians.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* The MI score seems to be quite good at identifying words that participate
 in idioms, set phrases and institutional phrases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* The average number of connectors per disjunct, which should have indicated
 the part-of-speech that the word belongs to, fails to do this.
 This seems to be due to the fact that the dataset is polluted with lists
 and tables (including tables-of-contents, and indexes), all of which are
 mis-interpreted as sentences by the processing software.
 This causes some very unusual disjuncts to be constructed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* In the earlier sample, derived from Wikipedia, it became clear that there
 were very few verbs that aren't relationship verbs.
 Wikipedia articles describe concepts and events.
 The relationship between these require the copula and other relationship
 verbs: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

has
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

was
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Wikipedia is almost completely devoid of narrative verbs: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ran
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

jumped
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thought
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

took
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Thus, we discern two very different styles of human communication: the
 exchange of facts, and the exchange of stories.
 Narratives contain a far richer selection of verbs, and thus, for language
 learning, a text corpus of narratives is required.
 Ideally, this would be from young-adult literature, which is a bit more
 direct in its kinesthetic content than adult literature might be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* Cosine similarity applied to connector sets seems to be an effective way
 of determining the grammatical similarity of words.
 Yet, it is not so unambiguously great, that other kinds of measures shouldn't
 be contemplated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Recap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The story so far: Starting from a large text corpus, the mutual information
 (MI) of word-pairs are counted.
 This MI is used to perform a maximum spanning-tree (MST) parse (of a different
 subset of) the corpus.
 From each parse, a pseudo-disjunct is extracted for each word.
 The pseudo-disjunct is like a real LG disjunct, except that each connector
 in the disjunct is the word at the far end of the link.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, for example, in in idealized world, the MST parse of the sentence "Ben
 ate pizza" would produce the parse Ben <--> ate <--> pizza and from this,
 we can extract the pseudo-disjunct (Ben- pizza+) on the word "ate".
 Similarly, the sentence "Ben puked pizza" should produce the disjunct (Ben-
 pizza+) on the word "puked".
 Since these two disjuncts are the same, we can conclude that the two words
 "ate" and "puked" are very similar to each other.
 Considering all of the other disjuncts that arise in this example, we can
 conclude that these are the only two words that are similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any given word will have many pseudo-disjuncts attached to it.
 Each disjunct has a count of the number of times it has been observed.
 Thus, this set of disjuncts can be imagined to be a vector in a high-dimensiona
l vector space, which each disjunct being a single basis element.
 The similarity of two words can be taken to be the cosine-similarity between
 the disjunct-vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equivalently, the set of disjuncts can be thought of as a weighted set:
 each disjunct has a weight, corresponding to the number of times it has
 been observed.
 A weighted set is more or less the same thing as a vector, and these two
 are treated as the same, in what follows.
 Note that the disjunct vectors are sparse: for any given word, almost all
 coefficients will have a count of zero.
 For example, the dataset that will be examined next has over a quarter
 of a million different pseudo-disjuncts in it; most words have fewer than
 a hundred disjuncts on them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some terminology and notation are introduced next, followed by a characterizatio
n of the dataset.
 This is followed by a statistical analysis of the word-disjunct pairs,
 and is followed by an analysis of the resulting word-similarity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Terminology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful to introduce some notation for counting words, disjuncts, and
 connectors.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w)$
\end_inset

 be the number of times that the word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 has been observed, in the dataset.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,d)$
\end_inset

 be the number of times that the disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 has been observed on word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 The pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(w,d)$
\end_inset

 is referred to as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

connector set
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cset
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the text below.
 Thus, for a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, there is a set 
\begin_inset Formula $(w,*)=\left\{ (w,d)|N(w,d)>0\right\} $
\end_inset

 of associated csets, called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

support
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the word.
 The size of this set can be written using the standard notation for set-sizes
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(w,*)\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, a disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, is supported by the set 
\begin_inset Formula $(*,d)=\left\{ (w,d)|N(w,d)>0\right\} $
\end_inset

 of associated csets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary contents of the database are the counts 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,d)$
\end_inset

 and everything else of interest in this section can be obtained from this.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,d)$
\end_inset

 can be understood as a matrix, where the disjuncts identify columns, and
 the words identify rows.
 In general, this is a very sparse matrix: the number of non-zero entries
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(*,*)\right|$
\end_inset

 is far less than the number of rows times the number of columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every time a word is observed in an MST parse, a disjunct is extracted for
 it; thus, word observations and disjunct observations are on one-to-one
 correspondence.
 In notation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{d}N(w,d)=N(w,*)=N(w)
\]

\end_inset

Similarly, the total number of times that a disjunct was observed is just
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N(*,d)=\sum_{w}N(w,d)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frequencies can be obtained by dividing by the total number of observations,
 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,d)=N(w,d)/N(*)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w)=N(w)/N(*)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $N(*)=\sum_{w}N(w)$
\end_inset

 the total number of observations of words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A single disjunct is always composed of a fixed number of connectors, independen
tly of any observations; let 
\begin_inset Formula $C(d,c)$
\end_inset

 be the number of times that connector 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 appears in disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $C(d,c)$
\end_inset

 is almost always either zero or one; however, a connector can appear more
 than once in a disjunct, so this count can rise to 2 or 3 or very rarely
 higher.
 The wild-card sum 
\begin_inset Formula $C(d,*)=\sum_{c}C(d,c)$
\end_inset

 is the total number of connectors in the disjunct; it is the vertex degree
 of all edges connecting to that disjunct.
 It is also useful to define 
\begin_inset Formula $C(d,+)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C(d,-)$
\end_inset

 as the total number of right-linking and left-linking connectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Dataset characterization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section was originally written in May 2017 and used to report data
 for a different dataset.
 However, a serious flaw was found in the code: all MI values had a minus
 sign in them, and thus all computed disjuncts were maximally-bad.
 The statistical analysis of this maximally-bad data wasn't horrible: it
 did behave reasonably.
 However, in the end, its still bad data, and so all charts and graphs are
 being revised with a new dataset.
 The old dataset was also terribly tiny.
 The new dataset is much larger.
 You can get the old version by digging in git, and pulling up commit 27a66643a5
2c0985adc5b38caf94fc25f5e2e684 (or maybe a bit earlier, circa late June
 2017 as that is when the bug was spotted.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following charts and analyses are derived from a single dataset, called
 'en_pairs_rfive_mtwo'.
 It contains data for word-pair statistics derived from parsing text from
 tranche-1,2,3,4,5 (See the download.sh scripts), followed by MST parsing
 of tranche-1 and 2.
 The word-pair statistics were obtained by applying random-tree parsing
 to entire sentences.
 The dataset is summarized in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Dataset-report"

\end_inset

 and repeated here.
 The column labels are explained there.

\begin_layout Standard
The dataset contains 851964 words.
 Of these, 137078 words that have disjuncts attached to them.
 These words have been observed a total of 18489594  times, for an average
 of 18489594/137078 = 21.70 observations per word.
 This dataset contains 6239997 different, unique disjuncts, for an average
 of 18489594 / 6239997 = 2.963 observations per disjunct.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The period appears 849354.0 times, suggesting that this many sentences were
 observed.
 Each sentence thus has an average of 18489594 / 849354 = 21.77 words per
 sentence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dataset contains 6239997 unique connector-sets, for an average of 18489594
 / 6239997 = 2.96 observations per cset.
 This last number that makes this dataset feel thin and sparse.
 Its not clear how accurate that perception is: an earlier dataset was about
 one-tenth to one-twentieth the size, in the number of words, disjuncts
 and observations, yet it had a ratio of 1.5 observations per cset.
 That is, making more than ten times the number of observations only doubled
 the observations per cset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dataset is sparse in a completely different sense: viewing 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,d)$
\end_inset

 as a matrix whose size is 
\begin_inset Formula $851964\times6239997$
\end_inset

, but only a very small number of these is non-zero: this is 
\begin_inset Formula $8629163/(851964\times6239997)=1.623\times10^{-6}$
\end_inset

.
 The sparsity of this matrix can be defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}$
\end_inset

 of this number, which is 16.60.
 The sparsity appears to increase with the number of observations: the previous,
 ten-times-smaller dataset had a sparsity of 15.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total word-entropy for the dataset is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{word}=-\sum_{w}p(w)\log_{2}p(w)
\]

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $H_{word}=9.71$
\end_inset

 bits.

 functions in disjunct-stats.scm Alternately, the print-matrix-summary-report
 now reports this.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The total connector-set entropy is much larger.
 It is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{cset}=-\sum_{w,d}p(w,d)\log_{2}p(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

and is measured to be 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{cset}=20.96$
\end_inset

 bits.
 The disjunct entropy is dual to the word entropy:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{disjunct}=-\sum_{d}p(*,d)\log_{2}p(*,d)
\]

\end_inset

and is measured to be 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{disjunct}=19.14$
\end_inset

 bits.
 The total mutual information between the words and disjuncts is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{cset}=\sum_{w,d}p(w,d)\log_{2}\frac{p(w,d)}{p(*,d)p(w,*)}=H_{word}+H_{disjunct}-H_{cset}
\]

\end_inset

and is measured to be 
\begin_inset Formula $MI_{cset}=7.897$
\end_inset

 bits.

Two graphs, dual to one-another.

\begin_layout Standard
The first ten words in the word ranking are: "LEFT-WALL" "," "." "the" "and"
 "to" "of" "a" """ "in".
 This is the ranking of how often these words appear, overall, in the MST-parsed
 corpus.
 The number of connections to LEFT-WALL should be equal to the number of
 sentences in the corpus, as the parser is set up to make one LEFT-WALL
 connection to a sentence.
 Most sentences will end in a period; some with question marks of other
 punctuation.
 Commas and the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can appear more than once in a sentence.
 The frequent occurrence of the straight double-quote mark is due to the
 fact that the corpus is heavily weighted with dialog: i.e.
 with fictional novels, where the characters are speaking a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This list is repeated in the table below.
 The support is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(w,*)\right|$
\end_inset

, that is, the number of different kinds of disjuncts observed for that
 word.
 The count is 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,*)$
\end_inset

, that is, the total number of times those disjuncts have been observed
 for that word.
 The frequency is just the count divided by 18489594.
 The length is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{len}(w,*)=\sqrt{\sum_{d}N^{2}(w,d)}$
\end_inset

, that is, the root of the sum of the squares of the observations.

The main point of this table is to demonstrate the log-likelihood column.
 At this point, these numbers won't seem to have much meaning; however,
 they provide an overall scale that will be seen, repeatedly, in the analysis
 below.
 The range of magnitudes -- 4 to 7 -- is no accident, and similar ranges
 will be seen later.

The first ten pseudo-disjuncts in the disjunct-ranking are ""+" ",-" "the+"
 "He+" "The+" "the-" "LEFT-WALL-" "I+" "“+" "to-".
 The meaning of the plus and minus signs was explained above; but to recap:
 the disjunct 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

xxx+
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that there are many words that expect to be followed by the word
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

xxx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (on the right).
 The disjunct 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that there are many words that want to link to the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the left.
 This is grammatically correct: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a determiner, and it is always the dependent of some noun.
 The disjunct 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The+
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is at first appears to be grammatical garbage/nonsense: it states that
 there are many words that want to link to the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the right.
 Naively, this is never correct for English; determiners always precede
 the noun that they modify.
 The capitalization gives away what is really happening: the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a sentence opener, and it is being linked by the LEFT-WALL, indicating
 the start of the sentence; 
\emph on
ergo
\emph default
, it is lining backwards.
 Similar remarks apply to ""+" "the+" "He+" "I+" "“+": Clearly, the capitalized
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a sentence opener, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is plausibly so.
 The two different styles of quotation marks (symmetrically vertical and
 right-leaning) open up dialog in fictional novels, which make up a large
 portion of the corpus.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above avoids the question of whether its is syntactically correct to
 link the LEFT-WALL to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 This is determined not by raw frequency counts, but by mutual information.
 This is explored later.
 At this point we can only say that such a linking is frequent, and cannot
 judge whether it is correct.

 This was commented on before: the corpus has many novels, and so many sentences
 will begin with quotes.
 Next comes a period which links to a double-quote on it's right.
 Last comes period followed by a leaning double-quote.
 Clearly, this is expected in the corpus.

Not visible in the top-ten, but can be seen in the top-fifty are mirror-images,

and
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The counts differ: the sixth-place "and: ,-;" had 32755 counts, while 14th
 place had 17745.
 Presumably this is due the comma having a different or more complex linkage
 about half the time.
 Other items in the top-50 that are not sentence openers include "”: ?-;"
 ",: but+;" ".: him-; "in: the+;" ".: ’+;" "”: .-;" "of: the+;".
 The first disjunct with more than one connector in is is "It: LEFT-WALL-

It

 wants to be a sentence opener, but wants to be followed by the word

 Not surprising.
 Proceeding down the list, the disjuncts continue in this manner.
 This does not necessarily mean that they are

\end_inset

high quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 It might be the case that the quality is given by the MI between the word

It is also interesting to turn the word distribution graph

 This is meant to be a simple exercise, so as to place some later graphs
 into context.
 Despite the simplicity, the analysis turns out to be somewhat surprising,
 and somewhat subtle.
 In particular, the last graph elicits some features in the dataset that
 are not otherwise easily visible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this dataset, there were 53076 words observed exactly once (out of a
 total of 18.5M observations of 137K words).
 This is quite something: of all the words observed, almost half were seen
 only once.
 More than half were seen twice, or less.
 These are presumably rare typos, foreign words, IPA pronunciation guides:
 any word that appears only once must be unusual; and yet, there are a lot
 of them! There are 17120 words that appear twice, 9081 that appear exactly
 3 times, 
\emph on
etc.

 These counts are graphed below.

This graph indicates that most (almost all) words were observed less than
 100 times.
 In this dataset, there were only 9425 words that were observed 100 or more
 times, 5683 words that were observed 200 or more times, and 3263 words
 that were observed 400 or more times.
 Percentage-wise: about 6.8% of the words were observed 100 times or more.
 This should be enough to give confidence in the syntactic usage of the
 commonly-used English words; but most of the rest of this dataset includes
 oddities of various sorts, including place names and given names.
 The challenge will be to see if these can be grouped into grammatical categorie
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 for the number of times that some word was observed, it appears that there
 are approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $53076\times N^{-3/2}$
\end_inset

 words observed that many times.
 In formulas, the size of the set of words 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ w|N(w)=N\right\} $
\end_inset

is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\left\{ w|N(w)=N\right\} \right|\sim N^{-3/2}\label{eq:word-distrib}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ w|\mbox{cond}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a set of words (subject to the condition cond) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\left\{ w|\mbox{cond}\right\} \right|$

 denotes the size of that set of words.

There is something interesting about this chart: it is more stable under
 varying dataset sizes than the Zipfian distribution.
 The slope of the Zipfian distribution changes, as datasets grow larger,
 typically trying to approach a slope of 1.0 very slowly.
 By contrast, the above 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{-3/2}$
\end_inset

 behavior seems to provide a much better description, even as the size of
 the dataset varies.
 I cannot demonstrate that assertion here, but have noticed it to be true
 when looking at other datasets.
\end_layout

The next graph belabors the point, and yet it's important.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Generated from binned-word-logli.dat
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It shows nothing new, but it does show it in a format that will be recur
 frequently, later.
 Thus, its worth understanding now.
 This graph shows exactly the same data as the previous graph: it 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 the same graph, except that the x-axis is now labeled differently, and
 some of the counts have been binned together.
 So first: note that 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}(1/18489594)=24.140$
\end_inset

 and so this is the location of the first spike on the far-right.
 Next, 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}(2/18489594)=23.140$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}(3/18489594)=22.555$
\end_inset

 are the locations of the second and third spikes: these correspond to words
 that have been observed 1,2 and 3 times.
 Words that have been observed exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 times will have a log-likelihood of 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}(N/18489594)=24.140-\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

.
 The formula 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:word-distrib"

\end_inset

, which was based on the graph above, can be rewritten as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\left\{ w|N(w)=N\right\} \right|\sim2^{-3/2\times\log_{2}N}
\]

\end_inset

which effectively predicts the height and location of the spikes.
 This is clearly demonstrated by the straight green line.

\begin_layout Standard
But then something else happens.
 As long as the bins are narrow, so that they are either full, or empty,
 then the nice power law holds.
 Once the bins become too wide to just hold single, discrete counts, but
 instead lump together different logli's, the apparent distribution changes.
 It is worthwhile to understand this phenomenon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This graph was generated by bin-counting.
 The x-axis was divided into 1200 equal-sized bins, and whenever the log-likelih
ood of a word landed within a particular bin, the count was accumulated
 into that bin.
 On the right side of the graph, many (most) bins are empty, because they
 do not correspond to logarithms of integers; this results in the spikes.
 The width of each bin is (24-9)/1200, and so when 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\log_{2}N-\log_{2}(N-1)\approx\log_{2}\left(1+\frac{1}{N}\right)\approx\frac{1}{N\log2}<\frac{24-9}{1200}=\frac{15}{1200}
\]

\end_inset

then multiple counts will be shoved into one bin.
 For this chart, this happens when 
\begin_inset Formula $N\approx115$
\end_inset

 so there are about 115 distinct spikes, and then they merge when the logli
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $24.140-\log_{2}115\approx17.3$
\end_inset

 which is the spot where the above graph bends from the green line to the
 blue line.
 From this point on, when multiple counts are being jammed into one bin,
 we expect the distribution measure to be given by the Jacobian determinant
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant
\end_layout

\end_inset

 of the point measure.
 We can compute this explicitly.
 Changing notation slightly, write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C(N)=KN^{-3/2}
\]

\end_inset

for the number of words that were observed 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 times.
 This is the same formula as before.
 For this dataset, 
\begin_inset Formula $K=53076$
\end_inset

.
 The bincount at logli
\begin_inset Formula $=x$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{bincnt}(x)=\sum_{x\le\log_{2}\left(T/N\right)\le x+\epsilon}C(N)\Delta N
\]

\end_inset

For this dataset, 
\begin_inset Formula $T=18489594$
\end_inset

.
 The binsize used in the above graph was 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=15/1200=1/80$
\end_inset

.
 In the above formula, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta N=1$
\end_inset

 is a notational trick to allow us to convert the sum into an integral when
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 gets large.
 We replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\int$
\end_inset

 and replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta N$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $dN$
\end_inset

 and write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{bincnt}(x)\approx\int_{x}^{x+\epsilon}C(N)\frac{dN}{dy}dy
\]

\end_inset

Here, there is a change-of-variable to 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\log_{2}\left(T/N\right)$
\end_inset

 or equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $N=T2^{-y}$
\end_inset

.
 The Jacobian determinant is then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|dN/dy\right|=N\log2$
\end_inset

 and so
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{bincnt}(x)\approx\frac{K\log2}{\epsilon\sqrt{T}}2^{x/2}
\]

\end_inset

Comparing this to the graph above, with logli
\begin_inset Formula $=x$
\end_inset

, we expect the bincounted region to have a slope of 0.5, and yet, the eyeballed
 fit above clearly shows 0.8.
 What's going on? WTF? Blame the data.
 Try again.
 The graph below shows exactly the same data, but this time there are only
 60 bins grand-total, and so only the first three spikes show.
 After that, the spikes merge together into bins.
 The green line is drawn exactly with the same slope and offset as before:
 that's because the first three spikes are in exactly the same locations
 as before, and have the same height.
 The blue line shows an eyeballed fit to the merged counts, and initially,
 it really does have a slope of 0.5, which is exactly what the Jacobian determina
nt was telling is it should be.
 Yayy! Declare victory and go home!

The purple line is an eyeballed fit to what the data is doing, when the
 number of observations really does become large.
 The knee in the graph is at about logli
\begin_inset Formula $=15.5=24.140-\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

 or, equivalently at 
\begin_inset Formula $N=400$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, we have to revise the apparent distribution.
 It is, for this dataset:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\left\{ w|N(w)=N\right\} \right|\sim\begin{cases}
N^{-3/2} & \mbox{for }N<400\\
N^{-1.8} & \mbox{for }N>400
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

It was noted before that there are 3263 words in the dataset that were observed
 400 or more times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does this mean? What is this saying? Its not entirely clear.
 It seems to suggest that there are about 3.3K words that are used preferentially
 more often than the rest.
 That is, they are used more often not only in absolute terms, but also
 in relative terms: the form a core of the vocabulary, enjoying a popularity
 exceeding the trend line for less-frequently used words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its not clear if this is a generic feature of the English language, or if
 this is peculiar to the particular corpus.
 Let's review the corpus again.
 The corpus comprises assorted late-19th and early 20th century texts from
 Project Gutenberg, a dozen sci-fi/fantasy novels, and a sampling of fan-fiction.
 These texts will contain stray markup, including tables of contents, chapter
 headings, indexes, figure captions and itemized lists.
 Quite often, ASCII artwork is used to delimit chapters or sections.
 Chapter headings are often written in all-upper-case.
 There are stray quotations in Latin, snippets of Latin prose and poetry.
 Travelogues will include miscellaneous foreign sayings and unusual place-names.
 All of this stuff adds up: it will be observed only once, twice, maybe
 a a few dozen times.
 It may as well be random text, from the point of view of the word-pair
 MI statistics, and from the point of view of the MST parser.
 There is no easy way to remove this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

garbage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in any 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 fashion.
 It is there, and it is unavoidable.
 It is indistinguishable from random sentences.
 However, it seems that the fact that some significant portion is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ungrammatical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should not affect word-count statistics, unless it just so happens that
 there is a core of 3.3K vocabulary words, followed by 130K words that are
 given names, arcane terms, and other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

junk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This does not seem plausible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, it is unclear on what the meaning of this knee in the graph really
 is, and how it should be explained.
 Note that this knee is NOT visible in the Zipfian distribution -- nothing
 happens at 
\begin_inset Formula $N=400$
\end_inset

 - it is smooth as silk.
 It maybe could have been visible in the

\begin_inset Formula $N=400$

, and does not continue past there! This seems to be a fairly subtle effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Ranked average observations per disjunct
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more interesting distribution arises by looking at the average number
 of observations per disjunct (per word).
 That is, a single word may have hundreds of disjuncts, observed thousands
 of times; what is the average number of times that a disjunct is observed?
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, it is explicitly meant 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,*)/\left|(w,*)\right|$
\end_inset

, the number of observations divided by the support for those observations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This number gives a hint of how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

narrow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the grammatical usage of a word is.
 If the average is high, it suggests that the word just does not have very
 many disjuncts on it; the few that it does have are observed a lot.
 Recall that these disjuncts (pseudo-disjuncts) connect to individual words,
 and not to word-classes.
 Thus, if a disjunct is seen a lot, it probably connects to another word,
 forming a high-MI pair.
 This can be explicitly seen in the example further below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A graph of the ranked average number of observations, per disjunct, per
 word, is shown on the left, below.

 The ranking is distinctly not Zipfian; this is confirmed by slicing the

 3263 words), excluding words with less than 100 observations (leaving 9425
 words), and excluding words with less than 20 observations (leaving 25505
 words out of 137K words).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graph on the right expresses an alternate view of the same idea: it
 shows a bin-count of all of the words.
 Reaffirming the graph on the left, it indicates that almost all words have
 an average disjunct observation count of less than four.
 It also conveys the sense that when the average disjunct count is greater
 than about four, that this is unusual, and perhaps meaningful in some way.

Closer examination indicates that more or less all words having an average

 The first 80 entries in the 400+ list have an average observation count
 of above three, and they are all boilerplate words: "fee" "copies" "trademark"
 "agreement" "electronic" "copyright" "donations", and so on.

The skewness appears to be very sharp.
 This suggests that we should not waste time looking at mean-square variations
 in the average, although we'll do this anyway.
 But first, its worth graphing the skewness directly.
 Again, this is done on a log-log graph, in a Zipfian way.

Its kind of a strange graph.
 Yes, the x-axis of this graph does imply that there are thousands of words
 with more than a thousand disjuncts on them, and hundreds that have more
 than ten-thousand (unique, different) disjuncts on them! Exactly what does
 this mean? This is covered in the next section.

Disjunct Support Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it possible that some words have a large number of disjuncts on them?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes, it is.
 For example, the comma was observed to have 243987 unique, different disjuncts
 associated with it.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has 215324 unique, different disjuncts, the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has 126861.
 Rounding out this list are "to" "of" "." "a" "was" "LEFT-WALL".
 Its not clear what fraction of these disjuncts are grammatically valid,
 and what fraction are junk.

Terminology: the

support
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of a vector is the number of basis elements that have a non-zero coefficient.
 This is the set 
\begin_inset Formula $(w,*)$

 defined earlier.

 a word, when counted

without

 Here, the RMS size
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

length
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be used to describe the root-mean-square size of the set of disjuncts
 associated with a word.
 That is, each element of the set is a disjunct, and that disjunct has a
 count, the number of times it has been observed.
 The root-mean-square of these counts can be taken as the set-size.
 But this set can also be interpreted as a vector, and so the RMS size is
 the same thing as the Euclidean length of the vector.
 Thus, the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

length
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is sometimes used for the RMS size; they're the same thing.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is computed by taking the root-mean-square of the counts on each disjunct
 in the set, that is, by computing 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\sum_{d}N(w,d)^{2}}$
\end_inset

 for each word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 and then ranking.
 Interpreting 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 as a basis element of a vector space, this can be recognized as the Euclidean
 length of the count-vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RMS size of the set is thus larger not only when more disjuncts have
 been observed, but also when most of the observations are made of only
 a small handful of disjuncts.
 That is, the RMS size should be relatively larger, if the word is less
 grammatically flexible.
 So for example, prepositions tend to be very flexible; adjectives, not
 so much.
 Thus, we expect adjectives to appear higher-up on this ranking list, than
 the observation-based list.
 And this might be true, relatively, but certainly not true absolutely.

\begin_layout Standard
The first dozen words of the RMS-size-list are: "LEFT-WALL" "." "and" ","
 """ "”" "in" "to" "of" "“" "as" "the".
 Not that interesting: these are all words that were observed a lot in the
 text.
 The RMS size is dominated by the total number of observations of a word
 in text.
 In and of itself, its insufficient to indicate how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

concentrated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the disjuncts are, how grammatically narrow a word is.
 For this, some other quantity is needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slope appears to be exactly -1.0, continuing the scale-free trend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Mean-square to size ratio
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More interesting is the ratio of mean-square size to the total size.
 In formulas, by ranking according to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{d}N^{2}(w,d)}}{N(w,*)}=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{d}p^{2}(w,d)}}{p(w,*)}
\]

\end_inset

This seems like the interesting ratio, because the Zipf exponent of -0.65
 would be doubled, when working with mean-square sizes, thus making the
 two rankings comparable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Words high in this score will be words that have relatively few disjuncts
 on them, or at least, few that matter much, that rise above the level of
 noise.
 The first ten words on this list, excluding punctuation, and excluding
 all words with fewer than 100 observations: "It" "and" "but" "in" "Two"
 "as" "Notes" "not" "There" "Summary".
 A review of the input corpus shows that the word "Summary" appears in only
 one input text: Charles Darwin's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

On the Origin of Species
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and then only to indicate an actual summary! The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Notes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 appears in less than a dozen input texts, with almost every usage being
 formulaic and rigid.
 The grammatical usage of these two words in the input corpus is fairly
 constrained, and thus it is no surprise that these have relatively narrower
 disjunct distributions on them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Excluding the capitalized words, and punctuation, in this list what remains
 is quite surprising.

It is surprising because, grammatically, we expect most of these words to
 have a large number of varied disjuncts attached to them.
 We expect them to be diffuse, not sharp: we expect that these would have
 a large number of observations smeared over a large variety of disjuncts,
 instead of having their weight concentrated in only a handful of disjuncts,
 the way that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Prince
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was, above.
 So what is going on, here?
\end_layout

Are there other interesting measures? One could contemplate the ratio of
 the mean-square size to the support 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{d}N(w,d)^{2}/\left|(w,*)\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Another possibility would be this, minus the average-squared, which would
 give the second moment, aka, the mean-square deviation from the average,
 specifically
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\sum_{d}N(w,d)^{2}}{\left|(w,*)\right|}-\left[\frac{N(w,*)}{\left|(w,*)\right|}\right]^{2}=\frac{1}{\left|(w,*)\right|}\sum_{d}\left[N(w,d)-\frac{N(w,*)}{\left|(w,*)\right|}\right]^{2}
\]

\end_inset

Neither of these variations seem promising; they seem to offer up more of
 the same, at least on this dataset.
 A larger and more refined dataset might reveal otherwise.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Mutual information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fractional mutual information
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for a pair is interesting to explore.
 Define this as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
MI_{pair}(w,d)=-\log_{2}\frac{p(w,d)}{p(w,*)p(*,d)}\label{eq:mi-word-disjunct}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fractional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that the total MI for the set of all pairs can be written
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{cset}=\sum_{w,d}p(w,d)MI_{pair}(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

Fractional MI is interesting because it usually has a reasonably nice distributi
on.
 For this particular dataset, it ranges from about -11 to +24.
 The distribution is shown in the graphs below.

These graphs are generated by computing the value for 
\begin_inset Formula $MI_{pair}(w,d)$
\end_inset

 for each of the 8629163 
\begin_inset Formula $(w,d)$
\end_inset

 pairs (aka 'connector sets'), and approximating it's distribution by bin
 counting.
 In each graph above, there are 200 bins, each of width of about 35/200,
 and each pair is assigned to one of the bins, according to it's MI value.
 The graph on the left then shows how many pairs there are in each bin.
 The graph on the left is similar, but not the same: it sums the frequencies
 for all the pairs in each bin.
 In formulas: the graph on the left shows the value of
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sizeof }\left\{ (w,d)|MI_{pair}(w,d)\mbox{ is in bin}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

while the graph on the right shows
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{MI_{pair}(w,d)\mbox{ is in bin}}p(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

where '
\begin_inset Formula $x\mbox{ is in bin}$
\end_inset

' simply means 
\begin_inset Formula $lo\le x<hi$
\end_inset

 with the bin being the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[lo,hi)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both of these graphs show 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

combs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the right side.
 These combs are exactly the same combs as noted in the last figure in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "logli distribution graph"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "logli distribution graph"

\end_inset

.
 The combs are due to the large number of words that have been observed
 only a small handful of times.
 In essence, the combs attest that the bulk of the high-MI pairs have been
 observed more than just a few times; 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 the high MI values are meaningful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both graphs show an eyeballed fit in green.
 The left graph shows that the distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian
 (visually a parabola, due to the logarithmic scale), given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-(0.23(MI_{pair}-11))^{2}/2$
\end_inset

.
 The shape of the graph on the right is harder to pin down.
 It has hints of parabolic behavior, yet the left edge appears more straight
 than curved, that is, to be exponential, given by 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{1.3MI_{pair}}=\exp0.9MI_{pair}$
\end_inset

.
 The eyeballed blue parabola is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-(0.15(MI_{pair}-12))^{2}/2$
\end_inset

, it's clearly missing a large excess in the middle of the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Marginal Mutual Information of Words
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The marginal mutual information of a single word can be defined by summing
 the (fractional) mutual information between a word, and all of it's disjuncts:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{word}(w)=\frac{1}{p(w)}\sum_{d}p(w,d)MI_{pair}(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

This is also written in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fractional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 style, so that, again, the total MI of the entire dataset can be written
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{cset}=\sum_{w}p(w)MI_{word}(w)
\]

\end_inset

That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $MI_{word}(w)$
\end_inset

 is the fractional contribution of the word to the total MI.
 The fractional marginal MI is very convenient for comparing different words,
 since it factors out the frequency of how often a word is observed: the
 MI of two words with two very different frequencies can be directly compared.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be seen from the graph below, the fractional marginal MI ranges between
 +3 and +18 for this dataset.
 The total MI for the dataset is measured to be 7.8969 bits.
 The distribution can be visualized in two different ways.
 The graph on the left, below
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is graphed by sorted-word-mi-hi-p in disjunct-stats.scm 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 shows the ranked MI of the 9425 words that have been observed more than
 100 times in this dataset.
 Note that it is a semi-log plot; it is NOT Zipfian.
 Note that the MI seems to decay logarithmically, for a good long ways,
 and then drops off a cliff.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graph on the right shows the distribution, for all 137078 words, bin-counted
 into 100 bins.
 The combs on the far right are again the same combs as noted in the last
 figure in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "logli distribution graph"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "logli distribution graph"

\end_inset

.
 The distribution appears to be Gaussian, and of approximately the same
 width as before, although located at a different center: the green line
 in the graph is the Gaussian given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-(0.24(MI_{word}-20))^{2}/2$
\end_inset

 as compared to 0.23 for the non-marginal MI distribution above.
 The difference between 0.24 and 0.23 seems to be significant: changing one
 to the other seems to give a noticeably poorer fit.

 few words in the ranking are: "LICENSE" "FULL" "formats" "BREACH" "AGREE"

 The word "LICENSE" is surely under-sampled, as, in this all-capitals form,

At the other extreme, the ten words with the lowest MI are: "it" "in" "of"
 "that" "to" "and" "the" "LEFT-WALL" "," "." ranging from 5.07 for "it" down
 to 3.33 for the period.
 These are already familiar from previous rankings: they occur with very
 high frequency; the disjunct lists on them will be lengthly variable, diffuse.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These samplings of disjuncts are sharply reminiscent of the technique of
 collocation used in corpus linguistics, but with a big, important difference.
 There, the linguist examines a window that is some 6-8 words wide, and
 examines the frequency of all phrases appearing within that window, containing
 the word-of-interest in the center.
 Here, we again have a word-of-interest, but this time, instead of seeing
 phrases, we see the grammatical structure revealed directly, by means of
 the disjuncts extracted from MST parses.
 The philosophical basis used to justify corpus linguistics, i.e.
 that of frequentism, is accepted and applied here as well.
 In this case, it is used to obtain grammatical structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Mutual information of disjuncts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Symmetrically, one also has the mutual information of a disjunct, in comparison
 to all of the words it connects to:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{disjunct}(d)=\frac{1}{p(*,d)}\sum_{w}p(w,d)MI_{pair}(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

Again, this is presented in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fractional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 style, so that the total MI of the entire dataset can be written as before:
\begin_inset Formula $MI=\sum_{d}p(*,d)MI_{disjunct}(d)$
\end_inset

The dataset contains 6239997 (6.24 million) unique disjuncts, observed for
 a total 18489594 (18.5 million) times.
 The distribution is shown below, with the disjuncts sorted into 200 equal-sized
 bins.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Fractional Entropy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a simpler variant than the mutual information, that is also worth
 understanding: the fractional contribution to the total entropy.
 This is given by the sum 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{word}(w)=-\frac{1}{p(w)}\sum_{d}p(w,d)\log_{2}p(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

This is written in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fractional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 style, so that the total entropy of the entire dataset can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{cset}=\sum_{w}p(w)H_{word}(w)
\]

\end_inset

 Analogously, one also has the fractional contribution of the disjuncts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{disjunct}(d)=-\frac{1}{p(*,d)}\sum_{w}p(w,d)\log_{2}p(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

where, again, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{cset}=\sum_{d}p(d)H_{disjunct}(d)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 It only shows those words that have been observed 100 times, or more.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It resembles the graph for the ranked fractional marginal MI, above.
 The graph on the right shows the distribution of the entropy, for all of
 the words.
 This affirms (or explains?) the sharp knee in the graph on the left: the
 knee occurs because almost all words have a large disjunct-entropy.
 Remarkably, the distribution is anti-Gaussian, in that it appears to diverge,
 the larger the entropy.
 In that respect, it cannot even be a proper distribution, as it cannot
 be normalized to a probability of 1.0 - the distribution increases without
 bound! Yet, as the graph illustrates, that is what it seems to be.
 The green curve is the anti-Gaussian, given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(0.27(FME-13.7))^{2}/2$
\end_inset

.
 As before, it has a width of approximately 1/4th.

The top-ranked words (which have been observed 100 times or more) are "clawing"
 "manages" "noting" "anyways" "circling" "choke" "neared" "urging" "pursuing"
 "exited".
 This is not a list that has been exposed with other statistics.
 Almost all of these are verbs, a grammatical class that never appeared
 in any of the previous lists.
 Why these? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these words have an entropy of exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $24.14021=\log_{2}18489594$
\end_inset

.
 Since there are a total of

18489594 observations of disjuncts in this dataset, the only way in which
 this entropy is possible is if every disjunct on these words was observed
 once and only once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking deeper into the disjunct set, the sensation that the words with
 the highest entropies are almost all verbs continues quite strikingly.
 A sampling is given in the table below.
 All of these words have a large support (i.e.
 have at least 100 observations of disjuncts on each), but each disjunct
 is observed only once, rarely twice; almost never more than that.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gripped
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has only one disjunct that was observed three times, seven that were observed
 twice, and 320 that were observed only once.
 A quick examination shows that many, maybe most, are grammatically reasonable,
 for example, for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gripped
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: (He- staff+) is the disjunct observed three times.
 Four of the seven observed twice are (had- him+) (she- his+ hand+) (He-
 staff+ tightly+) (his+ hand+) and look to be a part of rather formulaic
 sentences (possibly from the fan-fiction part of the corpus).
 The other three disjuncts observed twice are strange nonsense: (hands-
 Ross- at+ edge+ vanity+) (hand- jaw- other- top+) (LEFT-WALL- jockeyings-
 by+ them+).
 These seem to be the result of failed MST parses, depending, presumably,
 on word-pairs that were witnessed only a few times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This observation, and the table below, reinforces the need to the urgency
 of clustering words: by clustering words together into grammatical categories,
 this should increase the number of observations of category-pairs, improving
 MST parses, as well as increasing the number of observations of disjuncts,
 hopefully drowning out the weak and bizarre disjuncts.
 Given that the high-entropy words seem to be predominantly verbs, this
 suggests that clustering will be absolutely required to pick out the grammatica
l form of verbs.

The table employs a bit of notation worth reviewing.
 Recall the definition of the set that supports a word: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(w,*)=\left\{ (w,d)|N(w,d)>0\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

The notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(w,*)\right|$
\end_inset

 was used to indicate the size of this set.
 Extend this notation as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|(w,*)\right|_{k}=\mbox{sizeof }\left\{ (w,d)|N(w,d)\ge k\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(w,*)\right|_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the size of the support for when the disjuncts on word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 have been seen at least 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this table, it is now clear why 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

large entropy
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 can be intuitively understood to mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

many possibilities
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Each of these words was seen in a very broad setting of possibilities:
 in a sense, the broadest possible.
 Each of these words was observed with a vary large set of different disjuncts,
 and this set was as spread-out as possible: the vast majority of disjuncts
 were observed exactly once.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
More terms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some curious terms show up in relating the fractional mutual information
 to the fractional entropy.
 Expanding out the above summations, one obtains
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{word}(w)=H_{word}(w)+\log_{2}p(w,*)+\frac{1}{p(w)}\sum_{d}p(w,d)\log_{2}p(*,d)
\]

\end_inset

 The last term is bizarre...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Vertex degrees and hubiness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vertex degrees can be defined as the average number of connectors per disjunct.
 In principle, the vertex degree is an excellent indicator of the part of
 speech.
 For example, determiners, adjectives and adverbs typically have a degree
 of one: they have one connector, which is modifying the noun (or verb)
 that they act on.
 By contrast, nouns typically have a degree of two: one connector to attach
 to a verb, another to a modifier, and that's it.
 Verbs have a degree of three: one connector to a subject, one to a direct
 object, a third to an indirect object or a modifier.
 Of course, nouns might have two or more modifiers, or maybe zero modifiers;
 verbs are also quite variable, but the general concept of vertex degree
 is appealing.
 Closely related to this is the idea of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hubiness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which can be defined as the second moment of the degree.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, its worth looking at this.
 Define the average degree as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K(w)=\frac{\sum_{d,c}N(w,d)C(d,c)}{N(w,*)}
\]

\end_inset

This is graphed, below, for all words that have at least 100 observations.

\begin_layout Standard
This graph is unexpected.
 Having an average number of connectors that exceed 5 or 6 is intuitively
 surprising.
 In proper grammar, it would be hard to reach even this degree without having
 a transitive or ditranstive verb with several modifiers, and a particle
 or preposition.
 The first ten items are out of control.
 What's happening here? The first ten items in the ranking are: "|" "#"
 "+" "||" "_" "ASCII" "electronically" "Northup" "disclaimer" "u".
 The first five are presumably formating markup or possibly decorative markup
 in the texts.
 Three of the words appear to be license boilerplate.
 The name "Northup" appears in only one text in the corpus: an autobiography,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Twelve Years a Slave
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, by Solomon Northup.
 Besides the title-page, the word Northup appears repeatedly in the table
 of contents, which is bound to make for awkward parsing.
 This presumably 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

explains
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 why the average connector count would be 11.2 for this word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving further down this list, many of the words and symbols suggest that
 they appear in tables or lists embedded in the corpus.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

grammar
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, again suggesting a bad parse of a table mistaken for a sentence, and included
 in 18 different Wikipedia pages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The list continues in a similar way, for quite a while.
 The green line suggests that if some 30 or so pathological cases are ignored,
 the system settles down to a more respectable behavior.
 Entries 30 through 50 in the rankings are "Bay" "Street" "Island" "of"
 "century" "right" "Game" "Georgian" "or" "a" ";" "near" "Party" "team"
 "law" "Australia" "her" "research" "Church" "east" "Government".
 Notable is a preponderance of capitalized words, suggesting more tables
 of various sorts, and a complete lack of verbs.
 A spot-check of words like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

team
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

law
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shows that the pathological behavior continues.
 Several conclusions are possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One conclusion is that there is a severe shortage of verbs in Wikipedia
 articles, and this makes sense: its primarily descriptive, rather than
 active: running, jumping, hitting, putting, mixing, giving, setting are
 not the kinds of verbs that are required to describe a typical encyclopedia
 topic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another conclusion is that perhaps the number of observations of pairs are
 insufficient to get deep, reliable MST parsing.
 Junk links get used because there were not enough appropriate word-pairs
 seen to give a good-quality MST parse.
 A related conclusion is that the connector-set dataset is also too thin:
 The grammatically reasonable connectors are observed not even a few dozen
 times, barely pushing them out of the noise-floor of onesie-twosie observations
 of junk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So: bigger datasets, and an urgent need for non-Wikipedia content.
 Fiction, and presumably teen fiction should be filled with the kinds of
 active verbs describing human motions and actions, and should be absent
 of tables and lists masquerading as sentences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Hubiness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the above, hubiness can be defined as the second moment of the
 connector count:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
hub(w)=\frac{\sum_{d,c}N(w,d)C^{2}(d,c)}{N(w,*)}-K^{2}(w)
\]

\end_inset

Given the earlier Zipfian results on the average degree 
\begin_inset Formula $K(w)$
\end_inset

, it should be no surprise that a ranked listing of words by hubiness is
 very nearly identical to the listing for average degree.
 This is, after all, what the scale-free nature of the Zipfian distribution
 really means.
 Not only is the ranking nearly the same, but one also has the approximate
 equality 
\begin_inset Formula $hub(w)\approx2K(w)$
\end_inset

 to some ten or twenty percent.

\begin_layout Standard
The cosine similarity between two vectors is simply their inner product.
 In this case, given two words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}$
\end_inset

, it is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}N(w_{1},d)N(w_{2},d)}{\mbox{len}(w_{1})\mbox{len}(w_{2})}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{len}(w)$
\end_inset

 is the root-mean-square length (Euclidean length) of the connector-set
 vector:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{len}(w)=\sqrt{\sum_{d}N^{2}(w,d)}
\]

\end_inset

 Rating' 'Category ..

 Fandom' 'Stats ..
 Fandom' 'Category ..

 Character' 'she ..

 The first one has a cosine of exactly 1.0, and the rest are above 0.975.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Stats
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Category
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 have exactly one disjunct: it is 'LEFT-WALL- :+' That is, these appear
 as the first word in a sentence, and are immediately followed by a colon.
 The word 'Notes' has 27 distinct disjuncts, but only three are observed
 more than 6 times: 'Chapter- or LEFT-WALL- or End-' That is, 'Notes' appears
 either all by itself, or as the phrase 'Chapter Notes' or as 'End Notes'.
 The word 'Summary' has 47 distinct disjuncts, but only two appear more
 than 6 times: 'Chapter- or LEFT-WALL-' i.e.
 either as a solitary word, or as the phrase 'Chapter Summary'.
 This is why 'Notes' and 'Summary' are considered to be so similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing in this fashion: 'Rating' has 7 disjuncts, four of which are
 observed more than 6 times: '(LEFT-WALL- :+) or (LEFT-WALL- :+ Audiences+)
 or (LEFT-WALL- :+ Explicit+) or (LEFT-WALL- :+ Mature+)' This suggests
 it appears in a table of some sort.
 The first disjunct '(LEFT-WALL- :+)' accounts for its high similarity to
 both 'Stats' and 'Category'.
 So, yes, all these words have been discovered to behave in a grammatically
 similar fashion; however, this behavior is somewhat boring: they arise
 from the regularity of some table listing.

\begin_layout Standard
The pair 're ..
 non' seems strange, but closer examination shows that both are usually
 followed by a hyphen, and that this accounts for all of the observed similarity
 between these two.
 The pair 'don ..
 sama' is also strange.
 The similarity is due entirely to their linking to dashes and other punctuation.
 It seems to be due to a Finnish text that has snuck into the corpus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some more verbs are worth looking at.
 Here is 'leave ..
 take', below.
 Almost all of the similarity is due the infinitive form; the only other
 shared disjunct appearing in the table is 'to- it+', although there are
 more common disjuncts at lower counts.

\begin_layout Standard
The first prepositions in the list are 'in ..
 by' and so are worth a look.
 Most of the similarity is accounted for by having them precede a determiner.
 Why there is a strong link to a determiner is unclear.
 Whether there is also a strong link between the determiner and a subsequent
 noun is also unclear.

\begin_layout Standard
The above table clearly indicates why the cosine similarity between these
 four words is high.
 Yet, it is also disappointing: the primary reason is that they all take
 the determiner 'the', and occur at the end of phrases (the- ,+) or at the
 end of sentences (the- .+).
 This seems superficial, at best.
 After that, there's not so much similarity, and what there is still falls
 back onto the presence of determiners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The similarity above is predicated on the frequent pairing of a word with
 a determiner.
 The pairing itself is correct, but perhaps not entirely significant: the
 word-pairs that needed to appear in the MST parse to extract these disjuncts
 had almost abysmally low MI values.
 They were clearly high enough to allow the MST parse to move forward, but
 are not otherwise terribly promising.
 They are shown below.

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that, for word-pairs, that MI scores below 4 are considered to be
 quite poor.
 That the scores above are poor is not surprising: determiners link with
 almost any noun, but not to verbs: this is enough to get them into the
 2-3 range for MI.
 By contrast, the period can appear after almost any word, except maybe
 for prepositions, adjectives and adverbs.
 This is apparently enough to drive the MI positive, but that's all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above suggests that using the raw observation count to compute the cosine
 similarity is perhaps not the best way to compute similarity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Score Cosine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above results suggest that perhaps the correct way to assign a score
 is to total up the word-pair MI scores for each disjunct, and use that
 to form a cosine.
 That is, define
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
sc(w,d)=\sum_{c\in d_{+}}mi(w,c)+\sum_{c\in d_{-}}mi(c,w)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{+}\subseteq d$
\end_inset

 is the subset of connectors that connect to the right, and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{-}\subseteq d$
\end_inset

 is the subset of connectors that connect to the left.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $c\in d$
\end_inset

 is simply one of the words that the connector is connecting to.
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $mi(w,c)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $mi(c,w)$
\end_inset

 are the word-pair MI scores.
 The cosine similarity might then be defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sos}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}sc(w_{1},d)sc(w_{2},d)}{\sqrt{\sum_{d}sc{}^{2}(w_{1},d)}\sqrt{\sum_{d}sc^{2}(w_{2},d)}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea here is that connectors to punctuation, and connectors to determiners,
 which might be observed quite often, but have a naturally low MI score,
 will contribute relatively little to the overall cosine similarity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is this a reasonable thing to do? Well, the previous two tables already
 suggested that the four words 'city' 'house' 'village' and 'world' should
 be placed into the same grammatical class, simply because of the high frequency
 with which they connect to a determiner.
 More subtle differences carrying a semantic signal might be getting washed
 out in this process.
 Perhaps the sos cosine score would be more sensitive to those processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But, if we are inventing scores, much more is possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Overlap Similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cosine similarity is perhaps too strict: it judges that two words are similar
 when they share not only the same collection of disjuncts, but have these
 occur with the same frequencies.
 Perhaps its enough to say that two words are grammatically similar, if
 they simply share the same set of disjuncts.
 This suggests ignoring the relative counts, or at least, sharply filtering
 them.
 Thus, the overlap similarity can be defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{ovl}(w_{1,}w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}\sigma(N(w_{1},d))\sigma(N(w_{2},d))}{\sum_{d}\sigma(N(w_{1},d)+N(w_{2},d))}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)$
\end_inset

 is some sigmoid function.
 In the most basic case, its a step function: 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)=1$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $x>C$
\end_inset

 for some constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and zero otherwise.
 Each term in the numerator sum is one only when both disjuncts are present.
 Each term in the denominator is one when either disjunct is present.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This similarity measure essentially boils down to a normalized cylinder-set
 measure.
 That is, instead of interpreting the disjuncts as a basis for a vector
 space, they can be taken as independent observations in a Cartesian product
 space.
 This makes more sense than pretending that these form a vector space.
 Why is that? What makes the cosine angle, and vector dot products so appealing,
 is that they are preserved by rotations; yet there really is no reason
 to expect or desire rotational symmetry.
 In short, the idea that we are dealing with vector spaces give the wrong
 idea of what's going on: its more appropriate to view the set of disjuncts
 as elements of a product space.
 Product spaces have a natural measure: the cylinder-set measure.
 The overlap similarity is essentially 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(A\cap B)/\mu(A\cup B)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 the Borel measure, and the intersection/union being taken over the associated
 disjunct sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing in this vein, what should be taken as the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(A)$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

? The counting measure is a natural choice; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(A)=\left|A\right|$
\end_inset

 being the number of elements in set 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Because we also have a count associated with the members of the set, we
 can consider using the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{p}$
\end_inset

 norms for the measure.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|A\right|$
\end_inset

 is just the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

 norm; perhaps 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(A)=\left\Vert A\right\Vert _{p}$
\end_inset

 could also work.
 For the purposes here, this may be enough; note, however, that only 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}$
\end_inset

 satisfy one of the axioms of measure theory: namely, that when 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cap B=\varnothing$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(A\cup B)=\mu(A)+\mu(B)$
\end_inset

.
 The other 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{p}$
\end_inset

 norms do not satisfy this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The (opencog matrix) module currently implements an overlap similarity which
 computes the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

-norm based similarity: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{ovl}_{0}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\left|\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }0<N\left(w_{1},d\right)\right\} \cap\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }0<N\left(w_{2},d\right)\right\} \right|}{\left|\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }0<N\left(w_{1},d\right)\right\} \cup\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }0<N\left(w_{2},d\right)\right\} \right|}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }0<N\left(w,d\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the set of disjuncts 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 such that the cset 
\begin_inset Formula $(w,d)$
\end_inset

 was observed at least once.
 As always, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\left\{ x\right\} \right|$
\end_inset

 is the number of elements in the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x\right\} $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some experimentation was done with this similarity measure, but the results
 were not particularly impressive.
 What does become quickly apparent is that the most frequently observed
 words will necessarily have a low similarity to the low-frequency words.
 This is because the high-frequency words will have a large number of disjuncts
 observed with them, thus causing the denominator to grow large.
 The numerator, by contrast, stays small, essentially limited by the number
 of disjuncts observed on the low-frequency word.
 This behavior is not what we want.
 Intuition suggests that we really do want to be able to compare words,
 independent of how frequently they occur.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This suggests a modified form of overlap similarity, by normalizing to a
 common count.
 That is, one should work with 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,d)/N(w,*)$
\end_inset

, which can be understood as the normalized probability of observing a disjunct
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 on some word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 So, arrange the words such that 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w_{1},*\right)>N\left(w_{2},*\right)$
\end_inset

 and define 
\begin_inset Formula $K\left(w_{1},d\right)=N\left(w_{1},d\right)N\left(w_{2},*\right)/N\left(w_{1},*\right)$
\end_inset

 -- this makes the counts on 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}$
\end_inset

 directly comparable to those on 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}$
\end_inset

, giving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{rovl}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\left|\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }1\le K\left(w_{1},d\right)\right\} \cap\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }1\le N\left(w_{2},d\right)\right\} \right|}{\left|\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }1\le K\left(w_{1},d\right)\right\} \cup\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }1\le N\left(w_{2},d\right)\right\} \right|}
\]

\end_inset

That is, the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le N\left(w_{2},d\right)$
\end_inset

 simply tests for the presence or absence of disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $K\left(w_{1},d\right)$
\end_inset

 gives the probability of observing disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}$
\end_inset

, if 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}$
\end_inset

 had been observed as often as 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above considerations suggest a more appropriate definition for overlap
 similarity that allows for frequency-independent observations: namely
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{ovl}(w_{1,}w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}\sigma(f(w_{1},d))\sigma(f(w_{2},d))}{\sum_{d}\sigma(f(w_{1},d)+f(w_{2},d))}
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $f(w,d)=N(w,d)/N(w,*)$
\end_inset

.
 In this form, the numerator now starts to resemble the numerator of the
 cosine similarity measure: both the cosine numerator, and this numerator
 are computing a kind-of overlap or intersection of sets of disjuncts.
 The denominators differ.
 Based on gut intuition, the above measure may be be more suitable for judging
 similarity than the cosine measure, precisely because it emphasizes the
 set-like qualities of connector sets, as opposed to vector-like qualities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Disjunct Subsets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above line of thinking suggests that another interesting comparison
 can be made by looking for a subset relationship between the disjuncts
 on different words.
 For example, transitive verbs should have all the connectors that intransitive
 verbs do, plus some more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overlay similarity can be adapted for this purpose: two sets obey a
 subset relation 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subset B$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cap(1-B)=\varnothing$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This re-affirms the previous observation: we expect connector-sets to behave
 in a set-like fashion, not a vector-like fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Connector Similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another, dual kind of similarity that is very different from the
 above proposals.
 A single disjunct is an ordered list of (pseudo-)connectors: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d=\left(c_{1},c_{2},\cdots,c_{k}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where each pseudo-connector is a word, and a direction indicator.
 We can judge two connectors to be similar, and thus, two words to be similar,
 if they appear in a large number of disjuncts that would be identical,
 but for that one connector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some practical difficulties of writing code to discern this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Word-Pair Cosine Similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To correctly gauge the advantage of disjunct-based techniques, one could
 compare them to the same kinds of measures, but applied to word-pairs,
 instead of word-disjunct pairs.
 For example, the disjunct-based cosine similarity, can be contrasted against
 the simpler word-pair-based cosine similarity.
 This is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sim}_{pair}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{w}N_{pair}(w_{1},w)N_{pair}(w,w_{2})}{\mbox{len}(w_{1})\mbox{len}(w_{2})}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{len}(w)$
\end_inset

 is the root-mean-square length (Euclidean length) of the pair vector:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{len}(w)=\sqrt{\sum_{v}N_{pair}(w,v)N_{pair}(v,w)}
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{pair}(w,v)$
\end_inset

 is the count of having observed the ordered word-pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(w,v)$
\end_inset

.
 Equivalently, writing the normalized frequency of observing a word pair
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,v)=N(w,v)/N(*,*)$
\end_inset

, this similarity can be written in the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sim}_{pair}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{w}p(w_{1},w)p(w,w_{2})}{\sqrt{\sum_{v}p(w_{1},v)p(v,w_{1})}\sqrt{\sum_{v}p(w_{2},v)p(v,w_{2})}}
\]

\end_inset

Note that this similarity measure is NOT symmetric: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})\ne\mbox{sim}(w_{2},w_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 This is because it's built out of a manifestly non-symmetric count: 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,v)\ne p(v,w)$
\end_inset

 and should really be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,v)=p(R;w,v)$
\end_inset

 with the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 encompassing all of the constraints of pair-wise word relationships (including,
 for example, that the pair might have been extracted from a random planar
 tree parse).
 Of course, one could construct a symmetrized similarity measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point here is that this measure treats words as similar with they link,
 pair-wise, to the same kinds of words, with the same kinds of frequencies.
 This is not unlike the similarity that the disjunct-cosine is measuring,
 except that the disjunct carries additional grammatical information with
 it: it captures more complex relationships between the words in a sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Cosine Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cosine similarity was defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}N(w_{1},d)N(w_{2},d)}{\sqrt{\sum_{d}N^{2}(w_{1},d)}\sqrt{\sum_{d}N^{2}(w_{2},d)}}
\]

\end_inset

which, after dividing by 
\begin_inset Formula $N(*,*)$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,d)=N(w,d)/N(*,*)$
\end_inset

, gives the equivalent expression 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}p(w_{1},d)p(w_{2},d)}{\sqrt{\sum_{d}p^{2}(w_{1},d)}\sqrt{\sum_{d}p^{2}(w_{2},d)}}
\]

\end_inset

Comparing this to the expression for mutual information suggests that using
 the vector support, instead of the vector length, could be interesting.
 In particular, these might be interesting:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{com}(w_{1},w_{2})=-\log_{2}\frac{\sum_{d}p(w_{1},d)p(w_{2},d)}{p(w_{1},*)p(w_{2},*)}
\]

\end_inset

Perhaps the following is closer to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

original intent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of mutual information: let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{dot}(w_{1},w_{2})=\sum_{d}p(w_{1},d)p(w_{2},d)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{dmi}(w_{1},w_{2})=-\log_{2}\frac{\mbox{dot}(w_{1},w_{2})\mbox{dot}(*,*)}{\mbox{dot}(w_{1},*)\mbox{dot}(*,w_{2})}
\]

\end_inset

Or even
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{cmi}(w_{1},w_{2})=-\log_{2}\frac{\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})\mbox{sim}(*,*)}{\mbox{sim}(w_{1},*)\mbox{sim}(*,w_{2})}
\]

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{sim}(*,*)$
\end_inset

 serves to normalize the entire calculation, so that one is effectively
 computing with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{norm-sim}(w_{1},w_{2})=\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})/\mbox{sim}(*,*)$
\end_inset

.
 Some experiments cmi were performed,, and it quickly became apparent that
 cmi does 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the wrong thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: it singles out pairs that have a lot to do with each other, but little
 to do with anything else.
 Which discriminates 
\emph on
against
\emph default
 the clusters of similar words, which is not what we want.
 We don't want strange, unusual pairings; we want common, likely pairings.
 The level of discrimination can be severe: some really, really bad pairings
 show up, but only because they are unlike anything else.
 This score is strong when sim is weak, and is essentially picking up the
 tail-end of the sim distribution.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Quality Cosine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The motivation for using cosine similarity is to find pairs of words that
 act in a grammatically similar fashion: they are used in the same way,
 with the same kinds of disjuncts.
 However, observational counts are subject to the vicissitudes of the input
 text: perhaps, instead of using vectors where the components are given
 by the frequency, once could instead use components based on, say, the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the disjunct itself.
 A disjunct could be judged as being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $mi(w,d)=MI_{pair}(w,d)$
\end_inset

 as defined in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "eq:mi-word-disjunct"

\end_inset

 is high.
 This motivates a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality cosine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{qim}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}mi(w_{1},d)mi(w_{2},d)}{\sqrt{\sum_{d}mi^{2}(w_{1},d)}\sqrt{\sum_{d}mi^{2}(w_{2},d)}}
\]

\end_inset

But what if the high quality is based on a pathetically small number of
 observations? Whenever one has a small number of observations, one has,
 almost automatically, a high MI value, simply because these two things
 are seen together, and nothing else is.
 Perhaps there should be some observational weighting.
 One can contemplate defining 
\begin_inset Formula $pi(w,d)=p(w,d)mi(w,d)$
\end_inset

 and so the cosine 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{pim}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}pi(w_{1},d)pi(w_{2},d)}{\sqrt{\sum_{d}pi^{2}(w_{1},d)}\sqrt{\sum_{d}pi^{2}(w_{2},d)}}
\]

\end_inset

 The suitability of these different means of judging similarity is not clear.

 Its sort of interesting to read.

 perhaps not to surprising, as the double dash is often used to start new
 sentence phrases.
 That various forms of punctuation follow is not surprising.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this are various capitalized words.
 As noted previously, capitalized words are observed far less frequently
 than their u-capitalized counterparts -- usually only one capitalized word
 per sentence! Thus, capitalized words have far fewer disjuncts on them,
 thus making it easier for them to appear superficially similar, when they
 really should not be.

 'A' and 'Mai' are not similar, but then all of the given names are quite

\begin_layout Standard
Reading through the list of 797 words in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "tab:Block-ranked-words"

\end_inset

 reveals a lot of interesting runs.
 All this suggests that cosine similarity really is doing the right thing.
 Equally reassuring are the failures of similarity: the end of the list
 of 797 words is populated with Gutenberg license boilerplate words.
 This is good: they are at the end of the list because they don't fit into
 any other grammatical usage patterns.
 They don't fit because they have been observed hundreds of times, which
 propels them into the high-frequency category; yet, since they always appear
 in set phrases, they can't be similar to anything else.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Filtering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An earlier draft of this report showed a very different figure, which turned
 out to have been created based on what seemed to be a valid assumption,
 but turns out not to be so wise.
 It deserves a some discussion here, which is resumed in a later section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea (recaptured below) is that it can be a good thing to filter out
 noisy data.
 For example, one may choose to ignore words that have not been seen many
 times.
 This is the cut done up above: there are only 797 words observed with a
 length of 128 or greater.
 This is a convenient number only because it allows a 797-pixel-wide color
 plot to be made.
 A different cut might exclude words that were observed less than N times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another possibility, and this seems to be the fatal one, is to exclude disjuncts
 that are seen only a handful of times.
 Superficially, this seems like a very plausible thing to do.
 In practice, this turns out to be an almost completely disastrous cut.
 Setting it too high renders almost all capitalized words identical to one-anoth
er, having a similarity of exactly one.
 Capitalized words are observed only infrequently; discarding low-frequency
 disjuncts leaves the capitalized words almost naked, and thus essentially
 identical.
 Just about all of them connect to the LEFT-WALL, since they are the first
 word in a sentence, and so all of them share a very high observation count
 of links to LEFT-WALL, and low observation counts of links to anything
 else.
 Ergo: they are all similar, since they all start sentences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The damage doesn't stop there.
 It turns out that such trimming also raises similarity across the board:
 it ends up so that everything seems to be pretty darn similar to everything
 else, thus erasing too much of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

signal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that we are looking for.
 The original hope was to raise the signal-to-noise ratio by applying judicious
 cuts; but hope is not enough.
 Injudicious cuts can destroy the signal all too easily.
 Careful data analysis is needed; blind trust is not enough.

The legend is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Size The dimensions of the array.
 This is the number of unique, distinct words observed occurring on the
 left-side of a word pair, times the number of words occurring on the right.
 We expect the dimensions to be approximately equal, as most words will
 typically occur on both the left and right side of a pair.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Pairs The total number of distinct pairs observed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Obsn's The total number of observations of these pairs.
 Most pairs will be observed more than once.
 Distributions are typically Zipfian, as previous sections point out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Obs/pr The average number of times each pair was observed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Entropy The total entropy of these pairs in this dataset, as defined previously:
 for word-pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $(w_{L},w_{R})$
\end_inset

 it is 
\begin_inset Formula $H=-\sum_{w_{L},w_{R}}p(w_{L},w_{R})\log_{2}p(w_{L},w_{R})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
MI The total mutual information for the pairs in this dataset, as defined
 previously: 
\begin_inset Formula $MI=\sum_{w_{L},w_{R}}p(w_{L},w_{R})\log_{2}\left[p(w_{L},w_{R})/p(w_{L},*)p(*,w_{R})\right]$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The datasets are as below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_sim This contains text parsed from Wikipedia, only.
 As noted previously, Wikipedia is painfully short of verbs and pronouns.
 Compared to the Gutenberg datasets below, it is also very rich in foreign
 words and proper names (product and brand names, geographical place names,
 biographical mentions and other named entities).
 Issue: missing connectors the LEFT-WALL.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_tone_mst Text from Project Gutenberg 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tranche one
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, mostly all 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

famous authors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, popular, well-known 19th century books.
 Includes six modern sci-fi/fantasy novels from other sources, and some
 20th century non-fiction, including a military appraisal of Vietnam.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_ttwo_mst Tranche two - Everything from tranche one, plus fan-fiction
 from http://archiveofourown.org.
 Most of the selected texts were 10K words or longer.
 See the 'download.sh' file for the precise texts.
 Issues: tone_mst and ttwo_mst are missing connectors the LEFT-WALL.
 Certain types of punctuation is mis-handled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_tthree Tranche three - Everything in tranche two, plus several
 hundred of the most recently created Project Gutenberg texts, whatever
 they may be.
 See the 'download.sh' file for the precise texts.
 The _mst version has the same issues that ttwo_mst has, although some connector
s to LEFT-WALL do get added.
 The _mst version is probably not useful for similarity measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_rone_mst Same as en_pairs_tone_mst, but with minor issues fixed.
 However, links to LEFT-WALL still missing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_rtwo_mst As above, tranche 1 & 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_rthree As above, tranche 1,2 & 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_rfive As above, tranche 1,2,3,4 & 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
zh_pairs_sone A parse of Mandarin Wikipedia, with each individual character
 (hanzi) treated as a single item (so that, during pair-counting, pairs
 are formed between items).
 Non-Chinese characters are grouped into words in the normal way, by splitting
 according to white-space (and punctuation).
 Thus, the total dimensions of the dataset are given by the number of observed
 Chinese characters (hanzi) plus the number of observed non-Chinese words
 (and punctuation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
zen_pairs A parse of a small set of Mandarin novels, with text segmented
 into words by external third-party tools (provided by Ruiting).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, for some commentary, as to the summary stats.
 For English, as the number of pair observations increase, so do the number
 of unique, distinct words.
 The relation even seems to be linear: double the number of pair observations,
 and the number of different words also increases.
 This suggests something Zipfian at work.
 The explosion of words is hypothesized to be given names, although these
 datasets all fail to split hyphenated words, and so some may be due to
 that.
 The point is that the average observations per pair increases with difficulty,
 and the entropy and MI does not budge at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing the English _sim dataset to the _rone, _rtwo and _rthree datasets
 does provide some contrast: The _sim dataset, built from Wikipedia, is
 distinctly different from the Gutenberg datasets.
 Certainly, the prose style in the two datasets is quite different, with
 Wikipedia consisting of statements of facts (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

has
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 relational statements) concerning a broad range of named entities, whereas
 the Gutenberg texts are primarily narrative adventures (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

did
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

went
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 activity statements) involving fictional personages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing English to Chinese is very interesting.
 The Chinese dataset has three times, almost four times more observations
 per pair; equivalently about 3-4 fewer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is partly due to the fixed number of ideograms in the language.
 Remarkably, the entropy and MI are untouched.
 This suggests that the entropy and MI are capturing something about the
 human nature of language use, as opposed to something descriptive of the
 language itself.
 However, a lot more data would be needed to see if this is really true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's something else interesting going on, shown in the table below.

\begin_layout Standard
The columns are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Size The left and right dimensions, as before.
 Viz, the number of unique, distinctly different words observed on the left
 and the right side of a pair.
 Viewed as a matrix, this is the number of columns and rows in the matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Support The support is the average number of word-pairs that a word participates
 in (on the left, or on the right).
 Viewed as a matrix, this is the average number of non-zero entries in each
 row or column.
 Viewed as (row or column) vectors, this is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

support
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a (row or column) vector.
 Mathematically, this is the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

 norm of each vector: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(w_{L},*)\right|=\sum_{w_{R}}\left(0<N(w_{L},w_{R})\right)$
\end_inset

 and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(*,w_{R})\right|=\sum_{w_{L}}\left(0<N(w_{L},w_{R})\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Count The count is the average number of observations that a word-pair was
 observed, for a given word.
 Viewed as a matrix, this is the average value of each non-zero entry (averaged
 over rows, or columns).
 Viewed as vectors, this is the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}$
\end_inset

 norm divided by the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

 norm.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}$
\end_inset

 norm is just the wild-card counts 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w_{L},*)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N(*,w_{R})$
\end_inset

, where as always, the wild-card counts are defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w_{L},*)=\sum_{w_{R}}N(w_{L},w_{R})$
\end_inset

.
 The count shown in the table is then the average count: 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w_{L},*)/\left|(w_{L},*)\right|$
\end_inset

 for the rows, and likewise for the columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Length The length is the average length of the row and column vectors.
 This is the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{2}$
\end_inset

 norm divided by the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

 norm.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{2}$
\end_inset

 norm is just the standard concept of the length of a vector in Euclidean
 space.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $L(w_{L},*)=\sqrt{\sum_{w_{R}}N^{2}(w_{L},w_{R})}$
\end_inset

, and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $L(*,w_{R})=\sqrt{\sum_{w_{L}}N^{2}(w_{L},w_{R})}$
\end_inset

.
 The length is interesting, because it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

penalizes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 word-pairs with only a small number of counts.
 The act of squaring the count has the effect of giving much higher 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

confidence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to large observation counts: a word-pair observed twice as often is given
 four times the credit.
 The length shown in this table is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 length: it is 
\begin_inset Formula $L(w_{L},*)/\left|(w_{L},*)\right|$
\end_inset

 for the rows, and likewise for the columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here's what is so interesting in this table: the support, for Chinese,
 is outrageously different than it is for English.
 For a given item (hanzi, for Chinese, word, for English), the Chinese hanzi
 participates in three to four fewer item-pairs! Since pairs are formed
 on a sentence-by-sentence basis, this means that the variety of different
 hanzi that can occur in a single sentence is much more constrained, much
 more strongly correlated.
 Now, perhaps this comparison is not quite valid: because we are not comparing
 words to words, but rather English words to Chinese 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

morphemes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (in the sense that Chinese words are typically composed of 1, 2 or 3 hanzi).
 Still, its interesting and surprising.
 This has knock-on effects: the observational counts are much higher, as
 are the average lengths.
 It would be interesting to repeat the previously given analysis of the
 various distributions, and see how they differ.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Disjunct datasets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, datasets that hold disjuncts.
 This section used to report more data, but it was all flawed: the MI had
 a minus sign in it, causing all computed disjuncts to be maximally bad.
 Despite this, the results were similar to the below: observations and entropy
 fit in line, as expected.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{left}$
\end_inset

 entropy values were lower, hovered around 15, and the MI was int the 3-5
 range, while 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{right}$
\end_inset

 was unchanged and fit in line.
 You can find the original data in the git commit 9244905afdff191a39af8c5a6deab5
92d5a1558c.
