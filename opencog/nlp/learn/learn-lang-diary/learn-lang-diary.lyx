Collection of thoughts and notes, pursuant to language learning.
 Organized in mostly chronological order.

\begin_layout Standard
Easier said than done.
 Should be 'obvious' but its not.
 Goal: construct a set of linkage rules to model only the observed language,
 via link-grammar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Notes on Mutual Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Definitions.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R(w_{l},w_{r}))$
\end_inset

 represent the probability (frequency) of observing two words, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 in some relationship or pattern 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 Typically, its a (link-grammar) linkage of type 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 connecting word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 on the left to word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 on the right; however, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 can be more general than that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest model has only one type 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, the ANY type, and assigns equal probabilities to all words.
 But we know all words are not equi-probable, so let 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w)$
\end_inset

 be the probability of observing word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 We know from experiece this is a Zipfian distribution.
 We are then interested in the conditional probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R(w_{l},w_{r})|w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 of observing the two words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 in a relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R=R(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

, given that the two individual words were observed.
 From the definition of conditional probabilities, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(R)=P(R|w_{l},w_{r})P(w_{l})P(w_{r})
\]

\end_inset

Or that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(R|w_{l},w_{r})=\frac{P(R)}{P(w_{l})P(w_{r})}
\]

\end_inset

Here, the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 encompasses several facts: that one word is to the left of the other, and
 that they are connected by a certain link-type, as well as capturing other
 'ambient' information, perhaps such as other nearby words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need to harmonize here a little bit with the Deniz Yuret concepts and
 notation.
 He defines a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 of seeing the ordered pair; that is, the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is implicit.
 To make it explicit, we should write: 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},w_{r})=P(R(w_{l},w_{r}))$
\end_inset

 to indicate the relation explicitly, and to note that the order of the
 positions in the relation matter.
 Yuret also uses the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},*)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P(*,w_{r})$
\end_inset

 for wild-card summations, defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(w_{l},*)=\sum_{w_{r}}P(w_{l},w_{r})\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad P(*,w_{r})=\sum_{w_{l}}P(w_{l},w_{r})
\]

\end_inset

In practical use, one quickly observes that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},*)$
\end_inset

 is almost equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l})$
\end_inset

 but not quite, since 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},*)$
\end_inset

 is the probability of seeing 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 within the certain relationship or pattern, which must be less than the
 prior probability of observing 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 in general.
 Thus, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},*)\le P(w_{l})$
\end_inset

, which can be viewed as a conditional probability:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(w_{l},*)=P(R(w_{l},*))=P(R(w_{l},*)|w_{l})P(w_{l})\le P(w_{l})
\]

\end_inset

In practice, then, for word-pairs, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R|w_{l})$
\end_inset

 is almost equal to 1, but not quite.
 Inserting this into the above gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(R(w_{l},w_{r})|w_{l},w_{r})=\frac{P(R(w_{l},w_{r}))\ P(R(w_{l},*)|w_{l})\ P(R(*,w_{r})|w_{r})}{P(w_{l},*)P(*,w_{r})}
\]

\end_inset

Re-ordering this gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{P(R(w_{l},w_{r})|w_{l},w_{r})}{P(R(w_{l},*)|w_{l})\ P(R(*,w_{r})|w_{r})}=\frac{P(w_{l},w_{r})}{P(w_{l},*)P(*,w_{r})}\label{eq:basic pair}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The right hand side above is recognizable from Yuret's work; he defines
 the mutual information as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{MI}(w_{l},w_{r})=\log_{2}\,\frac{P(w_{l},w_{r})}{P(w_{l},*)P(*,w_{r})}\label{eq:Yuret's MI}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

so that large positive MI is associated with words that occur together only
 with themselves (e.g.
 '
\emph on
Northern Ireland
\emph default
' from his examples.) So, on the right, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 is usually very small, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w,*)\approx P(*,w)\approx P(w)$
\end_inset

 subject to the inequality given before.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LHS of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:basic pair"

\end_inset

 is a stranger to me.
 First, we have observationally seen that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R(w_{l},*)|w_{l})\approx P(R(*,w_{r})|w_{r})\approx1$
\end_inset

, and thus must conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R(w_{l},w_{r})|w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 is 'large'; much larger than (unconditional) word-pair frequencies.
 Anyway, as an equation, its kind-of nicer, since it clearly isolates the
 role of the relation, since, by defintion, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R(w_{l},w_{r})|w_{l},w_{r})=P(R(w_{l},w_{r})|w_{r},w_{l})$
\end_inset

 so that it functions like a real conditional probability, rather than this
 implicit-word-order thingy that Yuret uses.
 The Yuret notation is very convenient, but sometimes obscures things.
 OK, I think I'm done with that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Update 14 Jan 2014
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, The LHS of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:basic pair"

\end_inset

 then demonstrates how to obtain conditional entropies in general.
 Thus, given an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-point relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R(x_{1},x_{2,}\cdots,x_{n})$
\end_inset

 one computes first the unconditional probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R(x_{1},x_{2,}\cdots,x_{n}))$
\end_inset

.
 The conditional probability is then obtained as usual:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(R(x_{1},x_{2,}\cdots,x_{n})\,|\, x_{1},x_{2,}\cdots,x_{n})=\frac{P(R(x_{1},x_{2,}\cdots,x_{n}))}{P(x_{1})P(x_{2})\cdots P(x_{n})}
\]

\end_inset

The entropy is then built recursively by normalizing by the probability
 of wild-card relations:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
MI(R(x_{1},x_{2,}\cdots,x_{n})\,|\, x_{1},x_{2,}\cdots,x_{n}))=\log_{2}\frac{P(R(x_{1},x_{2,}\cdots,x_{n})\,|\, x_{1},x_{2,}\cdots,x_{n}))}{P(R(*,x_{2,}\cdots,x_{n})\,|\, x_{2,}\cdots,x_{n}))\, P(R(x_{1},*,\cdots,x_{n})\,|\, x_{1},x_{3,}\cdots,x_{n}))\cdots}\label{eq:Relation MI}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

(Right? We're not dividing by multiple *'s here, yes?) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
1 January 2014
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, after that side distraction, which helped clear up notation, back to
 the main show ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main show is this: We want to model language, and specifically, find
 a 'minimal' set of relations R that are accurately generative.
 The meaning of 'minimal' seems obvious, intuitively, but a lot harder to
 pin down mathematically.
 We need to pin it down to get an algorithm that works in a trust-worthy,
 understandable fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So: what is the total space of relations, and how do we find it? The simplest
 model is then a Zipfian distribution of words, but placed in random order.
 This model has a total entropy of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=-\sum_{w}P(w)\log_{2}P(w)
\]

\end_inset

For a recent swipe at parsing a few hundred articles from the French wikipedia,
 I get H=7.2.
 This is on 17K words, observed a total of 35M times (actually, observerd
 each sentence 100 times, so really just 350K 'true' observations of words).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does one count the entropy of the rule-set? Elucidating this is the
 goal-set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But first, step back: describe the rules.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK ...
 so, once again ...
 sentence structure is to be described via link-grammar, using disjoined
 conjunctions of connectors.
 This is theoretically sound, as it seems to be isomorphic to categorical
 grammars (via type-theory of the connectors; need a formal proof of this
 someday, but for now it seems 'obvious').
 Also link-grammar is fully compatible with dependency grammar.
 So lets move forward.
 But this is an old debate, off to the side, immaterial for now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
How to count relations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a sentence with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 words in it, numbered 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n}$
\end_inset

 left to right.
 We want to constrain grammar by discovering a set of relations 
\begin_inset Formula $R(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n})$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n}))>0$
\end_inset

 when the sentence is gramatically valid (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 such an 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 exists), and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is zero when no such 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 exists (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 the sentence is not gramatically valid.) The first and most obvious simplificati
on rule is to observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 can be replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $R(W_{1},W_{2},\cdots,W_{n})$
\end_inset

 where each 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}$
\end_inset

 is a set of words.
 That is, instead of listing each sentences individually, we list certain
 classes of sentences.
 In other words, the relations 
\begin_inset Formula $R(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n})$
\end_inset

 are in one-to-one correspondance with a list of grammatical sentences 
\begin_inset Formula $(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n})$
\end_inset

, so simply listing all possible sentences is a very verbose way of specifying
 a grammar.
 It is linguistically 'obvious' that sentences fall into classes, and so
 the two relations 
\begin_inset Formula $R('this','is','a','dog')$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R('this','is','a','cat')$
\end_inset

 can be replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $R('this','is','a',W_{n})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{n}=\{'dog','cat'\}$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{n}$
\end_inset

 can be a rather large set of nouns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So ...
 the question is: what is the reduction of complexity, by performing this
 classification? What is the correct way of counting? I assume that 'complexity'
 is a synonym for 'entropy', so we are looking to do two things: enumerate
 the states of the system, and proivde a measure for complexity.
 So, lets consider a language with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 nouns, so that the cardinality of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{n}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $|W_{n}|=N$
\end_inset

 and the only valid sentences are 
\begin_inset Formula $('this','is','a',w)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in W_{n}$
\end_inset

 .
 Before simplification, we had 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 relations 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, one per sentence.
 We also had 
\begin_inset Formula $N+3$
\end_inset

 sets, each set containing a single word; the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 nouns, and the three words 
\begin_inset Formula $'this','is','a'$
\end_inset

.
 After simplification, we have one relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, and four sets; three of the sets have cardinality 1, the fourth set has
 cardinality 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Revision: July 2014
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There seem to be several ways of counting.
 Some of these seem to give wrong answers.
 Some just seem wrong.
 This is all very confusing, so I've altered the entries to explicitly show
 the different ways of counting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Method 1 (naive counting):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One counting rule is to count set-membership relations on equal footing
 with structural relations.
 Thus, before simplification, we had 
\begin_inset Formula $N+3$
\end_inset

 sets, each a singleton, and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $N+3$
\end_inset

 set membership relations.
 After simplification, we have four sets, but still have 
\begin_inset Formula $N+3$
\end_inset

 set membership relations.
 Thus, this particular simplification step does not reduce the number of
 membership relations at all.
 This seems disconcerting...
 Let's provisionally go with this and see what happens.
 Thus, before simplification, we had 
\begin_inset Formula $2N+3$
\end_inset

 relations grand-total, and afterwords, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $N+4$
\end_inset

 relations grand-total.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the correct 'thermodynamic' picture of what's going on? In this
 toy problem, we have a grand-total state space of size 
\begin_inset Formula $(N+3)^{4}$
\end_inset

 since any of the 
\begin_inset Formula $N+3$
\end_inset

 words can appear in any of the four slots in a four-word sentence (micro-canonn
ical ensemble).
 The entropy, at 'infinite temperature' where all possible four-word sequences
 occur with equal probability is then 
\begin_inset Formula $4\log_{2}(N+3)$
\end_inset

.
 The entropy of the set of grammatical sentences is 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

 since there are only 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 possible grammatical sentences.
 In this toy grammar, there are also invalid setences of length 1,2,3,5,6,7,...
 and so the total size of the space of word-sequences is clearly infinite.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so the space of word-sequences is very concrete, and easy to describe
 and measure, at least for toy grammars.
 What about the space of relations? Well, the claim is that the entropies
 of the before-and-after models are 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}(2N+3)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}(N+4)$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 Neither of these matches the entropy of the set of allowed sentences (which
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

), so this seems paradoxical, and begs the questions 'did we count correctly?'
 and 'did we actually simplify anything by making the above change of descriptio
n?' Hmm.
 The correct answer seems to be 'no' and 'no'.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Method 2 (subtract one):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To 'fix' the oddball results above, an alternative counting methodology
 is to subtract 1 from the cardinality of every set.
 This would then give both 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

 as the entropy for both the before and after relation-sets.
 Thus, before, we had 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 relations and 
\begin_inset Formula $N+3$
\end_inset

 sets, each of weight zero, for a total weighted-relation count of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 After, we have one relation and four sets; three of the sets have weight
 zero, one set has a weight of 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

 so the total weighted relations is again 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 This seems to resolve the paradox.
 But why subtract one? That's a bizarre rule, almost unheard-of in information
 theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Method 3 (naive log addition):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Total complexity is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K=\log_{2}|Rel|+\sum_{W\in Wrds}\log_{2}|W|
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Rel$
\end_inset

 is the set of relations, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Wrds$
\end_inset

 is the set of word-lists, and 
\begin_inset Formula $|W|$
\end_inset

 is the cardinality of each word-list.
 We then get, before simplification, 
\begin_inset Formula $|Rel|=N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $|W|=1$
\end_inset

 for each of the word-sets.
 The total complexity is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $K=\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

 as expected (i.e.
 equal to the log of the total number of possible sentences).
 After simplification, there is 
\begin_inset Formula $|Rel|=1$
\end_inset

 and 3 sets with 
\begin_inset Formula $|W|=1$
\end_inset

 and one set with 
\begin_inset Formula $|W|=N$
\end_inset

, thus yeilding a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $K=\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

 again.
 This seems to give a plausible answer, and provides a plausible argument.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Method 4 (relational complexity):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Treating each relation as being equally complex seems odd.
 It would seem to make more sense to have each relation contribute according
 to its complexity, so that the contribution of the relations to the total
 complexity is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{R\in Rel}C_{R}
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{R}$
\end_inset

 the complexity of each relation, itself the log of some measure.
 But how do we measure complexity? Is it Kolmogorov complexity? There's
 no obvious 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 defintion for this.
 The defintion of this complexity would seem to depend on the particular
 algorithm machinery of the grammar; that is, on the 'programming language'
 used to represent the relation.
 This is the traditional ambiguity attached to the Kolmogorov complexity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Method 5 (corpus distribution):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of measuring the complexity of a grammatical expression (in an as-yet
 unkown grammar), instead, use the corpus frequency ass a proxy.
 For the above example, if the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 sentences are equi-distributed (i.e.
 occur equally likely in the corpus), then, before simplification, each
 of the relations has a complexity 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{R}=-\frac{1}{N}\log_{2}\frac{1}{N}
\]

\end_inset

so that, before simplification, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K=\sum_{R\in Rel}C_{R}=\log_{2}N
\]

\end_inset

which again seems to be the desired answer.
 After simplification, there is one relation that applies to the entire
 corpus, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{R}=0$
\end_inset

 after simplification.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Method 6 (corpus word-counts):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we are taking word-relation frequencies from the corpus, then we should
 be taking word-set frequencies from the corpus as well.
 That is, the word-set contribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}|W|$
\end_inset

 is assuming an equi-distribution.
 This should be replaced by the corpus contribution 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\sum_{w\in W}p(w)\log_{2}p(w)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Summary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Provisionally, the last two methods seem to be the best way to move forward.
 To summarize, the complexity is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
K=-\sum_{R\in Rel}P_{R}\log_{2}P_{R}-\sum_{W\in Wrds}\ \sum_{w\in W}P_{w}\log_{2}P_{w}\label{eq:counting complexity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{R}=P(R)=P(R(W_{1},W_{2},\cdots,W_{n}))$
\end_inset

 is the probability of observing the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 in a sample corpus, and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{w}=P(w|W)$
\end_inset

 is the probability of observing word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 in the corpus, conditioned on its appearence in the corpus having to do
 with it belonging to the word-class 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Counting Link-Grammar Relations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Per link-grammar, each relation is decomposable into pair-wise relations;
 this is the so-called 'parse' of a sentence.
 If the relation is a single word-per-slot sentence relation, then the 'parse'
 is literal.
 We write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n})=\prod_{j,k,m}R_{\alpha}(w_{j},w_{k},t_{m})\ Q(R_{\alpha},R_{\beta},\cdots,R_{\omega})\label{eq:pair-decompose}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\alpha}(w_{j},w_{k},t_{m})$
\end_inset

 is a single connected pair of words, connected by the connector 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{m}$
\end_inset

.
 The product symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\prod$
\end_inset

 implies that all such binary relations must hold.
 The awkward 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(R_{\alpha},R_{\beta},\cdots,R_{\omega})$
\end_inset

 at the end is the additional no-links-cross constraint in the current link-gram
mar parser.
 Its a non-local constraint involving all of the binary relations.
 It also subsumes any 'post-processing' rules, although, for the language
 learnign exercise, there won't be any post-processing rules.
 At any rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is a place where higher ordrer constraints can be applied.
 In particular, the most genneral form for 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$

Yuret proposes a way of discovering the pair-wise relations
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yuret1998"

\end_inset

.
 He makes the implicit, unvoiced assumption that there is a single, unique
 connector type 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{m}$
\end_inset

 for every ordered pair of words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j},w_{k}$
\end_inset

; that is, that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{m}=t_{m}(w_{j},w_{k})$
\end_inset

.
 Viz, specifically, that such connectors are in 1-1 correspondance with
 word-pairs.
 (I don't think he's aware of this assumption; I don't think anyone has
 ever before realized that he's making such an assumption; certainly, I
 haven't).
 Yuret then makes two claims: first, that the only possible grammatically
 correct parses are those of the above form (eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:pair-decompose"

\end_inset

) for which the relations 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\alpha}(w_{j},w_{k},t_{m}(w_{j},w_{k}))$
\end_inset

 have been previously observed; secondly, that there is a natural ranking
 of such allowed parses by summing the total mutual information associated
 with each word-pair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two concepts give rise to the idea of minimum-spanning-tree parsers.
 Such parsers work in a two-step process: a training phase, and a parse
 phase.
 In the training phase, one gathers a lot of statistics about mutual information.
 The important point here is that this is unsupervised training.
 To parse, one first creates a graph clique, with every word connected to
 every other.
 One uses the gathered MI to define graph edge lengths.
 Finally, the corrrect parse is then the maximum spanning tree of the graph
 (maximizing the MI, summed over the tree edges in the graph).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we use the same idea, but then take the next step.
 The spanning tree can be decomposed into a set of link-grammar disjuncts,
 one disjunct per word.
 The disjunct is merely a list of the connections that one word makes.
 It consists of the type, and the direction.
 The direction is left or right.
 The type is the 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{m}=t_{m}(w_{j},w_{k})$
\end_inset

 defined above.
 By parsing a large number of sentences, we can now automatically discover
 a large number of disjuncts, in an unsupervised manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal, the next step, is then to reduce the total number of disjuncts,
 and the total number of types, by clustering and discovering similarities.

Why does Yuret's MST work?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an interesting simplification that happens with minimum-spanning
 tree parsers driven by entropy.
 If we use Yuret's definition of the MI of word-pairs, then, Yuret says
 (I should re-read his stuff) that we should maximize the entropy 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{w_{l,}w_{r}}MI(w_{l},w_{r})\label{eq:MST entropy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Why? Why this, instead of the maybe 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more obviously correct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sum: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{w_{l,}w_{r}}P(w_{l},w_{r})MI(w_{l},w_{r})\label{eq:wrong MST entropy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

I think I can hand-wave the answer.
 The answer is that we don't really know the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
for the given sentence! 
\emph default
We know 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 for a large corpus, but its somewhat of a mistake to assume that this identical
 to what it would be for expressing a particular idea in a certain specific
 way.
 Its possible that, to express the idea, the only sentences that one could
 ever possibly use would have 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 that strongly deviate from a large-corpus average.
 Unfortunately, there is no easy way of knowing what this sentence-specific
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 is.
 So, instead we make the uniform distribution assumption, that they're all
 the same, and thus get eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:MST entropy"

\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:wrong MST entropy"

\end_inset

.
 Does Yuret ever make this argument himself? Dunno.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A supporting argument is that we also ignored 3,4,5-point interactions as
 well.
 Which brings us to the next point: why should we expect a link-parse to
 work better than an MST parse? Because Yuret-MST ignores the valence of
 words, whereas the disjuncts don't! The disjuncts provide a better, more
 accurate way of capturing valency!

\begin_layout Subsection*
Finding patterns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To problem.
 Consider an alphabet of 
\begin_inset Formula $N=5$
\end_inset

 letters, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\{A,B,C,D,E\}$
\end_inset

 and a corpus built from those letters.
 The five letters occur with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 Assume the corpus consists entirely of pairs AB, CB and DE, each occurring
 equally often: so: 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A,B)=p(C,B)=p(D,E)=1/3$
\end_inset

 .
 From this, we can reconstruct that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A)=p(C)=p(D)=p(E)=1/6$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(B)=1/3$
\end_inset

.
 This follows because the corpus can be reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $\{AB,CB,DE\}$
\end_inset

, so A occurs 1 out of 6 times, B two out of 6 times, etc.
 The total single-letter entropy is thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{SING} & =-\sum_{w\in\alpha}p(w)\log_{2}p(w)\\
 & =-\frac{4}{6}\log_{2}\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{3}\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}\\
 & =\frac{2}{3}-\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}=2.25163
\end{align*}

\end_inset

By contrast, in a random 2-letter corpus, we expect all possible letter
 pairs to occur equally often, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w)=1/5$
\end_inset

, which would result in 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{RAND}=-\log_{2}1/5=2.321928$
\end_inset

 and so we see that the total entropy for this corpus is less than the random
 corpus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total double-word entropy is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{PAIR} & =-\sum_{w_{1},w_{2}\in\alpha}p(w_{1},w_{2})\log_{2}p(w_{1},w_{2})\\
 & =-\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}=1.5849625
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Compare this to 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{PR-RAND}=-\log_{2}1/25=4.643856$
\end_inset

 for the random 2-letter corpus.
 The pair-entropy is sharply lower.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What do we know about mutual information? We can also deduce that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(*,B)=2/3$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A,*)=1/3$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
MI(A,B) & =\log_{2}p(A,B)-\log_{2}p(A,*)-\log_{2}p(*,B)\\
 & =\log_{2}3/2=0.585
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $MI(C,B)=MI(A,B)$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $MI(D,E)=\log_{2}3=1.585$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By contrast, in a random 2-letter corpus, we expect all possible letter
 pairs to occur equally often, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w_{1},w_{2})=1/25$
\end_inset

, which would result in an 
\begin_inset Formula $MI(w_{1},w_{2})=\log_{2}1=0$
\end_inset

 for all word pairs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given this corpus, we wish to deduce the following answer: there is a cluster
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\{A,C\}$
\end_inset

 and two link relations 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\gamma,B)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R(D,E)$
\end_inset

 occuring with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\gamma,B)=p(A,B)+p(C,B)=2/3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(D,E)=1/3$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\gamma,*)=p(A,*)+p(C,*)=2/3$
\end_inset

 so that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
MI(\gamma,B) & =\log_{2}p(\gamma,B)-\log_{2}p(\gamma,*)-\log_{2}p(*,B)\\
 & =\log_{2}3/2=0.585
\end{align*}

\end_inset

So how do we deduce this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, consider the reduced space, with 
\begin_inset Formula $N=4$
\end_inset

 letters: 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\{\gamma,B,D,E\}$
\end_inset

.
 In this space, only two pairs are observed in the corpus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $DE$
\end_inset

 with probabilities as above.
 The single-letter probabilities are 
\begin_inset Formula $p(D)=p(E)=1/6$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\gamma)=p(B)=1/3$
\end_inset

.
 The single-letter entropy is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{SING}^{red} & =-\sum_{w\in\beta}p(w)\log_{2}p(w)\\
 & =-\frac{2}{6}\log_{2}\frac{1}{6}-\frac{2}{3}\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}\\
 & =\frac{1}{3}-\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}=1.9182958
\end{align*}

\end_inset

This can be compared to the entropy of the random 4-word corpus: 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{RAND}^{red}=-\log_{2}1/4=2$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{RAND}^{red}-h_{SING}^{red}=0.081704>0.070298=h_{RAND}-h_{SING}
\]

\end_inset

In other words, the reduced corpus shows more order than the comparable
 unreduced corpus! Interesting! The above can be written as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{SING}-h_{SING}^{red}=0.333334>0.321928=h_{RAND}-h_{RAND}^{red}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What about the reduced pair entropy? For this case, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{PAIR}^{red} & =-\sum_{w_{1},w_{2}\in\beta}p(w_{1},w_{2})\log_{2}p(w_{1},w_{2})\\
 & =-\frac{2}{3}\log_{2}\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{3}\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}\\
 & =-\frac{2}{3}-\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}=0.9182958
\end{align*}

\end_inset

which can be compared to the random-pair entropy of 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{PR-RAND}^{red}=-\log_{2}1/16=4$
\end_inset

.
 The comparable reduction is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PR-RAND}^{red}-h_{PAIR}^{red}=3.081704>3.0588935=h_{PR-RAND}-h_{PAIR}
\]

\end_inset

So again, this wins, but not by a lot.
 Re-ordering, this can be written as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}-h_{PAIR}^{red}=0.6666667>0.643856=h_{PR-RAND}-h_{PR-RAND}^{red}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we seem to have two ways of winning: reducing the overall entropy, for
 for single letters, and for pairs, and also finding reductions that are
 strong, even compared to the reduced vocab.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Reductio ad absurdum? No.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What if we continue on this path, and (incorrectly) reduce to 
\begin_inset Formula $N=3$
\end_inset

 letters, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\{\gamma,\eta,D\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=\{B,E\}$
\end_inset

? Then 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\eta)=p(B)+p(E)=1/2$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{SING}^{rr} & =-\sum_{w\in\delta}p(w)\log_{2}p(w)\\
 & =-\frac{1}{6}\log_{2}\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{3}\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{2}\log_{2}\frac{1}{2}\\
 & =\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{2}\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}=1.4591479
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and the reduction inequality is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{SING}^{red}-h_{SING}^{rr}=0.4591479>0.4150375=h_{RAND}^{red}-h_{RAND}^{rr}
\]

\end_inset

So this inequality allows an inappropriate reduction to take place.
 That implies that we must not use the SING inequality to obtain reductions!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the pairs, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\gamma,\eta)=p(\gamma,B)=2/3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(D,\eta)=p(D,E)=1/3$
\end_inset

 and everything else being zero.
 Thus one gets:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{PAIR}^{rr} & =-\sum_{w_{1},w_{2}\in\delta}p(w_{1},w_{2})\log_{2}p(w_{1},w_{2})\\
 & =-\frac{2}{3}\log_{2}\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{3}\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}\\
 & =-\frac{2}{3}-\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}=0.9182958
\end{align*}

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{red}-h_{PAIR}^{rr}=0\ngtr0.830075=h_{PR-RAND}^{red}-h_{PR-RAND}^{rr}
\]

\end_inset

Here, nothing is gained, so the pair inequality blocks the inappropriate
 reduction.
 Consider a differnt inappropraite reduction to 
\begin_inset Formula $N=3$
\end_inset

: let 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=\{\zeta,B,E\}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=\{D,\gamma\}$
\end_inset

 Then the pair probabilities are 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\zeta,B)=p(\gamma,B)=2/3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\zeta,E)=p(D,E)=1/3$
\end_inset

 and again, there is no entropy reduction.
 The other groupings look to be equally ineffective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Finding Patterns, General Formula
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, recast the above section for the (semi-)general case of word-pairs (not
 structures in general).
 So, given a vocabulary of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 words, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{RAND}=-\log_{2}\frac{1}{N}=\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{RAND}^{red}=\log_{2}(N-1)$
\end_inset

 so that for large 
\begin_inset Formula $N,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{RAND}-h_{RAND}^{red}=\log_{2}N/(N-1)=\log_{2}(1+1/(N-1))\approx1/N$
\end_inset

 and so we have a word-combine winner if we can combine words A and C into

 What's not clear: is this inequality

 it seems clear that we should not use the SING inequalities to obtain clusters.

\begin_layout Standard
For pairs, its clear that

 The corresponding inequality is now
\begin_inset Formula

=-\sum_{w\in\alpha\backslash A,C} & \left[p(A,w)\log_{2}p(A,w)+p(C,w)\log_{2}p(C,w)-p(\gamma,w)\log_{2}p(\gamma,w)\right]\\
-\sum_{w\in\alpha\backslash A,C} & \left[p(w,A)\log_{2}p(w,A)+p(w,C)\log_{2}p(w,C)-p(w,\gamma)\log_{2}p(w,\gamma)\right]\\
 & -p(A,A)\log_{2}p(A,A)-p(C,A)\log_{2}p(C,A)+p(\gamma)\log_{2}p(\gamma)\\

\begin_layout Subsection*
Freedom and Constraint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concepts of freedom and constraint are central to the definition of
 algebra in mathematics.
 So for example, in group theory, the algebraic symbols denoting the elements
 of the group may be arranged freely, in any order desired.
 A given group is then defined as a 'presentation', a set of equivalences
 between different orderings.
 Thus, there is the notion of a 'free group', which is merely a set of symbols
 that can be written in arbitrary order, and no further constraints other
 than those of it being a group.
 Groups that aren't free are presented by a collection of equations, which
 state that one certain order of symbols is equivalent to another.
 One says that groups are 'equationally presented'.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more complex example is the term algebra, where the terms may be arranged
 in free order; but the combination of the written symbols on the page are
 constrained to those of the 'signature' of the algebra.
 One then has the notion of an 'equational theory', which is a term algebra
 with additional equations between expressions, indicating which expressions
 should be taken as equivalent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These have strong, and even precise analogues in linguistics.
 But first, continuing with the mathematical observations: the signature
 of a term algebra can be viewed as defining the 'syntax' of the symbolic
 notation: a Turing machine, tasked with the need to recognize the 'language'
 of the term algebra, would process input symbols one by one.
 It would appear that term algebras have a context-free syntax, and are
 thus recognizable by a push-down automata.
 That is, one must recognize the function symbol, the open and close parens,
 the commas separating arguments, and the constant symbols.
 The arbitrary-depth recursiveness is the only reason why the push-down
 is needed; otherwise the language seems 'almost regular'.
 (Hmm ...
 is there any formal definition/distinction of this case? i.e.
 for very simple constext-free languages, vs.
 'more complex' ones? Not that I know of ...)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In linguistics, similar notions of freedom and constraint arise, but seem
 to be more of a surprise and mystery to linguists.
 Thus, for example, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Anderson2012"

\end_inset

, Anderson describes the syntax and morphotactics of Kwakw’ala, a Wakashan
 language of coastal British Columbia.
 The syntax of the language (that is, the order in which the words can appear
 in a sentence) is very strict: the verb must be followed by a subject,
 optionally followed by the object, and then a prepositional phrase.
 Similarly adjectives must always preceed the noun.
 The language also has a rich morphology: words are assembled from stems
 and suffixes.
 The rules for assembling a word out of stems and affixes is refered to
 as the 'morphotactics'.
 In Kwakw’ala, it would appear that the morphotactics is utterly distinct
 from the syntax: here, object-denoting prefixes can preceed verbs, adjective-de
noting suffixes follow a noun.
 Anderson finds this quite remarkable: the language has two distinct kinds
 of structure-imposing systems: the syntax and the morphtactics, and they
 are quite different.
 He notes that this dual structure in turn allows the same thing to be said
 in multiple ways.
 One may take meaning-parts, as morphemes, and glue them together morphtacticall
y into words, and aranging these in a sentence.
 Allternately, one may take the meaning-parts separately, as individual
 words, and glue them together into a sentence, having a different sequence
 of the meaning-parts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The part that struck me with Anderson's analysis is the similarity of the
 phenomena to the analogous behaviour formalized in mathematics.
 Lets first look at a second example: Lithuanian has a rich morphotactical
 structure: verbs and adverbs are conjugated, nouns and adjectives are declined;
 the rules for doing so are rather fixed and uniform, making adjustments
 mostly for phonological reasons (i.e.
 with exceptions based on constraints that come from the natural flow of
 the sound sequences constrained by the use of vocal cords, mouth, tongue
 and lips).
 Curiously, Lithuanian is almost devoid of syntactic constraint: word-order
 can be chosen freely (in the mathemaitcal sense!), and the meaning of the
 resulting sentences are esentially the same (if I am allowed to gloss over
 the notion that different word orders can serve to highlight or emphasize
 different themes and rhemes).
 So again: a language with very distinct syntax and morphtactics; in this
 case, the syntax being almost absent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I used the theory of Link Grammar for performing structural linguistic analysis.
 The theory was originally developed to model syntactic structure, but it
 also appears to be entirely adequate for morphotactic analysis as well
 (certainly, for 'agglutinative' or 'concatenative' languages, with ongoing
 research into more complex morphologies).
 From the point of view of a linguist, Link Grammar appears to be 'just
 another theory of syntax', being a kind of dependency grammar.
 From the point of view of a mathematician, the situation is entirely more
 remarkable.
 It appears that the mathematical defintion of what constitutes a 'link
 grammar' is isomorphic to that of a 'categorical grammar', and that the
 correspondance is immediate and direct.
 Categorical grammars are interesting because they have a direct, formal
 mathematical definition that is studied and classified by mathematicians:
 roughly speaking, categorical grammars are 'non-symmetric compact closed
 monoidal categories'.
 The precise definition here has been championed by Bob Coecke ref [xxx]
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It takes some study of category theory to understand what this means, but,
 roughly speaking, it means that sequences of sounds, morphemes, words are
 analyzed in sequential order: by means of short-distance groupings of left-righ
t arrangements.
 This may sound silly, as, of course, sequential things occur in a sequence,
 but it helps highlight the difference between dependency grammars and phrase-st
ructure grammars, or computer-science grammars in general.
 An example of a 'computer-science grammar' is the so-called 'context-free
 grammar'.
 A hallmark of such grammars is that they allow recursion to arbitrary depths.
 An English-language example would be the sequence of sentences: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is a house
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This thing is a house.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This thing is a thing that is a house.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This thing is a thing that is a thing that is ...
 a house.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The example is silly because no one ever talks that way.
 The phrase-structure analysis of this would be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

(S (VP (NP (VP (NP ...
 )))))
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, with the heirarchical arrangement emphsized.
 Dependency grammars can also parse such sentences, but here, the arrangment
 of dependencies are in the form of arrows that point from head word to
 dependent word; the arrows are only rarely long-range, and usually point
 to the immediately-surrounding words.
 There is strong psycho-linguistic evidence for such local structure in
 language, see for example [xxxx].
 That is, the workings of the human mind is not recursive in nature, pushing
 and popping an arbitrarily deep stack as each new noun-phrase or verb-phrase
 is enountered.
 Indeed, psychological studies with constructed sentences similar to the
 above, but varying the 'thing' and 'house' at each depth, show that humans
 quickly loose track after just two or three nestings [need ref].
 In essence, the human mind is adapted for linear sequential analysis, and
 long-range order between words is challenging: this is the psycho-linguistic
 argument for dependency grammars.
 From the mathematical point of view, the statement is that human languages
 are not so much context-free, as they are non-symmetric compact closed
 monoidal categories.
 That Link Grammar is an example of the latter is why it seems so appropriate
 to use for syntactic and morpho-tactic structural analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which theories of langauge are mathematically isomorphic? That is, Link
 Grammar and categorical grammars seem to be isomorphic because there is
 a simple way of translating the one into the other, and vice-versa (although
 no formal mathematical proof of this has been written down).
 A mathematical proof of equivalence is a mechanical device: given one represent
ation, one turns a crank to obtain the other.
 More generally, its been argued that phrase-structure grammars and dependency
 grammars are equivalent in the same sense: there is an algorithm that converts
 the one into the other, and v.v.[where's the ref for this?].
 Does this mean that non-symmetric compact closed monoidal categories have
 context-free grammars as their internal language, and that every context-free
 language has a corresponding monoidal category? I think not, but the answer
 to that, the 'why not', and the 'what, then, is the difference?' is entirely
 unclear.
 Clarifying these relationships seems important for putting language study
 on a firmer basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, the point here was to clarify the boundaries between freedom and
 constraint.
 Traditional phrase-structure grammars were inspired by notions from 1960's-era
 computer science, but now seem slavishly wedded to the same ideas, to the
 detriment of closer linguistic understanding.
 Dependency grammars seem to be more psycho-linguistically valid, but have
 suffered from a lack of mathematical formalism that ellucidates freedom
 and constraint.
 This lack of formalism makes it hard to explain why some constructions
 are grammatically correct, and others are not.
 It also seems to draw an artificial and confusing line between syntactic
 and morphotactic structure, when, in fact, these really should be taken
 as a part of a continuum of structure.
 I see no reason why a single grammar could not also describe the allomorphic
 variations in pronunciation.
 After all, these are just a set of rules that govern how a morpheme is
 pronounced, and this is essentially a linear, sequential phenomenon, with
 only (mostly?) nearest-neighbor morphemes affecting one-another.
 The nearest-neighbor aspect of this fairly well screams out 'dependency'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another curious and interesting language-constraint structure emerges with
 the study of idioms and institutionalized, set phrases.
 Because these are 'phrases', built of 'words', it would naively seem that
 tese lie in the domain of syntax.
 But this is misleading.
 Institutionalized utterances are those where neither the word-choice nor
 the word-order are directly governed by syntax alone, but instead seem
 to be frozen into a fixed form.
 So, one talks of the 'time of day', but never of 'pressure of air' or 'height
 of mountain' -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What pressure of air should I put in this tire?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What height of mountain do you plan to climb?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What time of day do you expect to come over?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 There is nothing syntactic that prevents such a choice of wording, and
 the semantic meaning is more or less clear: its just that such word arrangement
s simply don't happen.
 Its as if the lexis for English has a phrase in it: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time-of-day
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which should be treated as a single word, rather than the three words
 it is written as.
 This provides the first hint of the role of probability in this discussion:
 the probability of seeing the phrase 'height of mountain' in English approaches
 zero: in fact, this text that you are reading right now just might be the
 only place ever in the history of the world in which this phrase has appeared
 ...
 despite it being 'grammatically valid'.
 Freedom and constraint aren't just governed by true-false distinctions,
 but by probabilities.
 The question then is, 'what is the most natural way in which to express
 such probabilities?' 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last is not just some idle intellectual question, but in fact, an engineerin
g question: the proper structure should have an immediate and direct effect
 on how well, and how quickly a language could be learned, via unsupervised
 machine-learning algorithms.
 A universal but naive attitude in the artificial-intelligence community
 is that 'oh.
 everything is a neural net, and we should use neural nets to build AI.'
 Less frequently, one may seem a similar attitude regarding Hidden Markov
 Models (HMMs).
 The fact that such naive approaches lead to algorithms that fail to converge
 quickly leads to ideas such as 'deep learning': a modification that explicitly
 splits a problem into layers, with explicit feedback between layers.
 Another variation used to escape the trap is to explicitly model what is
 un-known: this is the notion of maximum entropy (MaxEnt).
 Traditional AI was also founded on logic and reasoning, and, for many decades,
 AI was dominated by the exploration of boolean-valued logic.
 By this I mean anything with crisp, sharp truth values: whether first-order
 logic, boolean satisfiability, satisfiability-modulo-theories, stable-model
 semantics, and so on.
 Another corner was fuzzy logic, but that didn't seem to have legs.
 Notions of maximum entropy and probability can be unified: thus, one has
 Markov Logic Networks (MLN).
 What I'm wodering about here is that maybe none of these approaches are
 correct, because they are ignoring the actual structure that is in front
 of us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, perhaps, the correct approach is not to marry maximum entropy with first-ord
er logic, but to marry maximum entropy to dependency grammars (or, equivalently,
 to appropriate monoidal categories).
 The question then becomes: what is the appropriate monoidal category? Picking
 the wrong one will lead to disasterous machine learning performance (this,
 I think, is the lesson from neural networks).
 Picking something too easy doesn't get you far enough (the lesson of HMM's
 -- excellent for certain classes of problems, but lacking in scale).
 There are more choices than that: but the chices, and their inter-connectedness
, and trade-offs, seem to be unarticulated.
 For any given monoidal category, there would seem to be some probabilistic
 model corresponding to that category's internal langauge.
 That is, there is a way of describing the transition probabilities from
 state to state.
 Indeeded, (finite) monoidal categories, in the form of acts, can be partly
 understood to be finite state machines acting on a set.
 The probabilistic generalization of this leads both to probabilistic and
 quantum finite automata, with the former having a strong resemblance, if
 not identity, to Markov chains, with the corresponding acts being HMM's.
 My hypothesis is that probabilistic dependency grammars will lead to machine
 learning algos that converge more rapidly than the similar-but-different
 HMM that can also be mapped onto the same problem.
 Unfortunately, my hypothesis is impedded by my lack of understanding of
 precisely, exactly how the different approaches named above may be equivalent,
 isomorphic, or merely similar.

Link Grammar and Finite State Transducers

\begin_layout Standard
Claim: Finite state transducers, such as those used for morphological analysis,
 can be mapped to a Link Grammar.
 This implies that Link Grammar parsing can be used for morphological analysis,
 thus unifying syntactic parsing and morphological analysis into a unified
 framework.A finite state transducer (FST) is defined as:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula $Q$

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
A member 
\begin_inset Formula $(r,a,b,s)\in\delta$
\end_inset

 should be thought of as the arrow from state 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 to state 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, the arrow being taken when the input symbol is 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and as a result producing the output symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 The corresponding link-grammar dictionary entry for this would be 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     a.b: r- & s+;
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This states that no linkage is possible, unless the previous link resulted
 in the emission of the r+ connector.
 No transition to the next state is possible, unless that state has an s-
 connector on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current link-grammar notation a.b is awkward for printing, and perhaps
 some new style is needed to distinguish the output to be printed from the
 input that is recognized.
 Thus, perhaps, it would be better to invent a new notation, perhaps a$b
 to denote that a is recognized, and that b is printed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the above definition of link-grammar rules results in a very simple,
 linear linkage: state transitions follow one-another in linear order.
 Link grammar allows richer, more complex linkage diagrams, and so the question
 arises: can a given FST be compactified into a smaller system by making
 use of the richer possibilities that link-grammar offers? How can this
 compactification be acheived?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that the FST 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 includes as a subset the state transitions 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(r,a,?,s),(s,\epsilon,\epsilon,t),(s,b,?,t),(t,c,?,u)\}$
\end_inset

.
 The symbol ? is used here as a don't-care state, as it is irrelevant to
 the discussion that follows.
 The above state transitions indicates that when the system is in state
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, it may spontaneously transition to state 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, or may do so upon reading 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the presence of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is optional in the state transition.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 way of indicating this with link-grammar notation is using the link-grammar
 dictionary entries: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   a: r- & s+;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   b: t+;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   c: {t-} & s- & u+;
\end_layout

\end_inset

Because the transition 
\begin_inset Formula $(s,\epsilon,\epsilon,t)$
\end_inset

 reads no input, and produces no output, the state transitions would more
 likely be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(r,a,?,t),(r,a,?,s),(s,b,?,t),(t,c,?,u)\}$
\end_inset

, that is, by collapsing the transition 
\begin_inset Formula $(s,\epsilon,\epsilon,t)$
\end_inset

 into the prior state.
 This would have the entries
\end_layout

 This is to be done by entropy minimization, in two different ways: first,
 ENF reduces the total count of terms, for just one single expression.
 Second, and maybe more important: different words will share significant
 subsets of the ENF expression.
 So, for example, the LG English dicts define:

 Second, the discovery of morphotactics is identical to the discovery of

\begin_layout Standard
OK, this will be tedious, but I see no alternative.
 Suppose we have the corpus 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

test gift tester testy gifty tester gifter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tester
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 appears twice in the corpus.
 Explore all possible splits into two parts.
 The 4-letter splits split 3 ways, the 5-letter splits split 4 ways, etc.
 so there is a total of N(*,*)=3+3+5+4+4+5+5=29 pairs.
 All pairs appear once, except for tester, which appears twice.
 Viz.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
P(x,y)=1/29 for (x,y) in {(t,est), (te,st), (tes,t), (g,ift), (gi,ft), (gif,t),
 (t,esty), (te,sty), (tes,ty), (test,y), (g,ifty), (gi,fty), (gif,ty), (gift,y),
 (g,ifter), (gi,fter), (gif,ter), (gift,er), (gifte,r)}
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
P(x,y)=2/29 for (x,y) in {(t,ester), (te,ster), (tes,ter), (test,er), (teste,r)}
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

There is a bit of a procedural error in the above; we would like to discover
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

null suffix
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, that is, that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

test
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, with nothing following it, are morphemes, so that the possible suffixes
 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-y
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-er
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-nothing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, the above failed to count this possibility separately.
 Thus, given the above data, what we expect to find are two roots: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gif-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tes-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and three suffixes: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-t
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-ty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-ter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is not so bad.
 If we did split and count in such a way as to allow a null suffix, it would
 be ambiguus as to whether the stems end with a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

t
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or not.
 That is, the with-t and without-t stems would have been equally likely...
 Anyway, moving on...

Next, lets do the partial sums.
 Recall the notation for the partial summation of pairs.
 writing P(x,y) for the probability of observing the 
\emph on
ordered
\emph default
 pair of items (x,y), the partial sums are: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(x,*)=\sum_{y\in Y}P(x,y)
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(*,y)=\sum_{x\in X}P(x,y)
\]

\end_inset

 The left-hand sums are the column totals in the table above, table

Now, the compute the MI (we use log=log_2 in all cases below, for measuring
 the entropy in units of bits).
 Recall the definition of mutual information for 
\emph on

 pairs, previously discussed and given above: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI(x,y)=\log_{2}\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x,*)P(*,y)}
\]

Phew.
 I think that's all of them.
 So, what can we conclude? The basic claim is that the morpheme boundaries
 occur at the places where the letters are the least sticky, the most likely
 to be de-correlated, i.e.
 those with the lowest MI.
 In the above, these are: MI(gif,ter)=1.69 followed by MI(tes,t)=MI(tes,ty)=1.86.
 These are the most likely splits for these three words.
 Lets look up each possible split, for each word.
 We get:

What looks like the best split has been found; it certainly matches what
 was expected.
 Yay! After this, link-type clustering proceeds just as before, as if these
 were distinct words.
 That is, the above has 6 distinct link types; clustering will then proceed
 discover one link type, between the cluster {gif, tes} and {t,ty,ter}.

That algorithm works only for concatenative languages, and does not provide
 a morphotactic structure; that is, it cannot learn the grammar governing
 the morphemes.
 It also requires several (plausable) assumptions about Bayesian priors.
 One assumption is that morpheme frequency follows a modified Zipfian distributi
on, this is used to make estimates for morphemes that are observed only
 once in the corpus.
 Another assumption is is that the morpheme length distribution can be approxima
ted by either a Poisson or a (two-parameter) gamma distribution.

This is inuitively obvious, because the morphemes obviously form a clique:
 each stem has been observed with each suffix.
 Technically, this is a bipartite clique or complete bipartite graph of
 order (2,3).
 Here, we see it immediately; however, in general, it is very hard to search
 for bipartite cliques in a grammar; general algorithms are provably NP-complete
 and run in exponential time.

Following the previous formulas, we compute the total pair entropy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{PAIR}^{observed} & =-\sum_{w_{1},w_{2}\in\alpha}p(w_{1},w_{2})\log_{2}p(w_{1},w_{2})\\
 & =-\frac{5}{7}\log_{2}\frac{1}{7}-\frac{2}{7}\log_{2}\frac{2}{7}=2.521641
\end{align*}

\end_inset

This is a bit of a misnomer, or misleading; we are actually computing the
 link-entropy: so the set is actually 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\{GA,GB,GC,TA,TB,TC\}$
\end_inset

 the first five of which were observed once, and the last was observed twice.
 So really we should write:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{observed}=-\sum_{t\in\beta}p(t)\log_{2}p(t)

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

 being the probability of observing link-type 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above is the observed entropy, given the corpus, and the grammar shown
 in listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:Morpheme-grammar"

\end_inset

.
 However, this grammar does not have any probability indicators attached
 to it, so that if it was used to generate a corpus, the entropy would be
 different.
 Basically, the probability of observing any of the link-types would be
 identical, and so the entropy would be:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{PAIR}^{generated} & =-\sum_{t\in\beta}p(t)\log_{2}p(t)\\
 & =-\frac{6}{6}\log_{2}\frac{1}{6}=2.584963
\end{align*}

\end_inset

This is obtained by observing that there are 6 link types in the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and so, if chosen equi-probably, the resulting entropy is just 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}6$
\end_inset

.
 For a given number 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 of link types, the entropy of the generated grammar will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

, for this extremely simply type of grammar, where all disjuncts have only
 one connector in them.
 The generated entropy will always be maximal for the grammar, as the observed
 distribution will surely never be equi-distributed.
 Thus, we have as a general principle:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h^{observed}\le h^{generated}
\]

\end_inset

Note that the equi-distributed link-types is the same as having each of
 the words in the corpus appear with equal frequency.
 The morphemes, however, do NOT appear with equally frequency (although
 individually, all stems do, and all suffixes do).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Link type reductions can be many ways.
 In each case, we look to see if adding a new word to a category improves
 the score.
 The possibilites are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group =ter and =ty together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group =ter and =t together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group =ty and =t together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group gif.= and tes.= together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this, we have more reductions:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.a.
 Add =t to {=ter, =ty}, and finally group together gif.= and tes.=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.b.
 Group together gif.= and tes.=, and finally, add =t to {=ter, =ty}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.a, 2.b.
 3.a 3.b variations of above
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.a.
 Group =ter and =ty together, then add =t.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.b.
 Group =ter and =t together, then add =ty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.c.
 Group =ty and =t together, then add =ter.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This gives 9 different orders in which the reductions can take place.
 Actually, only 6: case 1b and 4a are the same, as are 2b=4b and 3b=4c.
 Lets do at least some of them.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Case 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\{\mbox{=ter, =ty}\}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the link types GB and GC need to be consolidated: GG={GB, GC} and
 likewise TT={TB, TC}.
 The dictionary becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     gif.=: GA+ or GG+;

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =t: GA- or TA-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =ty =ter: GG- or TT-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

The observed pair probabilities become: 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(GA) = p(gif,t) = 1/7 = p(TA) = p(tes,t)
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(GG) = p(gif,ter) + p(gif,ty) = 2/7
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(TT) = p(tes,ter) + p(tes,ty) = 3/7
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So the observed entropy is now
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{red1.}=-\frac{2}{7}\log_{2}\frac{1}{7}-\frac{2}{7}\log_{2}\frac{2}{7}-\frac{3}{7}\log_{2}\frac{3}{7}=1.842371
\]

\end_inset

The generated entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{gen}^{red1.}=\log_{2}4=2$
\end_inset

 since there are four total link types in the reduced grammar.
 Pursuant to equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:counting complexity"

\end_inset

, we should add the log of the cardinality of the word-sets.
 Here, only one word-set has a cardinality greater than one: {=ty, =ter}.
 So, one gets:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{gen}^{wrds1.}=\log_{2}2=1
\]

\end_inset

The conditional entropy, based on the textual observations, is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{obs}^{wrds1.}=-\frac{3}{5}\log_{2}\frac{3}{5}-\frac{2}{5}\log_{2}\frac{2}{5}=0.970951
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Case 1.a.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\{\mbox{=ter, =ty, =t}\}$
\end_inset

 Then the link types GA and GG need to be consolidated: G={GA, GG} and likewise
 T={TA, TT}.
 The dictionary becomes

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

The observed pair probabilities become: 
\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_layout Standard
p(G) = p(gif,t) + p(gif,ty) + p(gif,ter) = 3/7
\begin_inset Newline newline

p(T) = p(tes,t) + p(tes,ty) + p(tes,ter) = 4/7
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So the observed entropy is now
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{red1.a.}=-\frac{3}{7}\log_{2}\frac{3}{7}-\frac{4}{7}\log_{2}\frac{4}{7}=0.985228

\end_inset

The generated entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}2=1$
\end_inset

 since there are only two link types in the grammar.
 The word-counting entropy for the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 contributes an additional 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{gen}^{wrds1.a.}=\log_{2}3=1.584963

\end_inset

while the observed entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

 The link types consolidate: EA={GA, TA} and EM={GG, TT}.
 The dictionary becomes

\begin_inset Newline newline

So that the entropy is

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{red1.b.}=-\frac{2}{7}\log_{2}\frac{2}{7}-\frac{5}{7}\log_{2}\frac{5}{7}=0.863121

\end_inset

The generated entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}2=1$
\end_inset

 since there are only two link types in the grammar.
 The word-set counting probability adds 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{gen}^{wrds.1.b.}=2\log_{2}2=2

\end_inset

 while the observed probabilities are
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Other cases.

\begin_layout Standard
Case 2.a.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(LL) = 7/7
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline

So that the entropy is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{final}=-\frac{7}{7}\log_{2}\frac{7}{7}=0
\]

\end_inset

The generated entropy is

 The word-set counting probability adds

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the above initial dictionary, we hope to deduce one word class that
 contains gif.= and tes.= and another that contains =t and =ter; eactly how
 the rest plays out is unclear.
 Lets begin by starting with the un-clustered entropy, and then see what
 hapens if we try various different clusters.
 So, as before, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\{GA,GB,GC,TA,TB,TC,BB,BF\}$
\end_inset

 and write:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{PAIR}^{observed} & =-\sum_{t\in\beta}p(t)\log_{2}p(t)\\
 & =-\frac{6}{11}\log_{2}\frac{1}{11}-\frac{2}{11}\log_{2}\frac{2}{11}-\frac{3}{11}\log_{2}\frac{3}{11}\\
 & =2.845351
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

 being the probability of observing link-type 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Since there are 8 different link types, the generated entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{PAIR}^{generated}=\log_{2}8=3$
\end_inset

.
 The different between these two is 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}-h^{obs}=0.154649$
\end_inset

.
 The observed corpus also has 8 words in it (not counting multiplicity):
 this is by design; before reduction, there is always exactly one link type
 for each morpheme pair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets look at several cases:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group gif.= and tes.= together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group gif.= and blo.= together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group =t and =ty together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group =ty and =fu together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group =ter and =fu together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we expect case 1 to go easily, cases 2 and 3 to to be ambiguous or
 blocked, case 4 to be weakly blocked, and case 5 to be strongly blocked.
 So, proceeding:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Case 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Group gif.= and tes.= together.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\{\mbox{gif.=, tes.=}\}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the link types G* and T* need to be consolidated: A={GA,TA} and likewise
 B={GB,TB} and C={GC,TC}.
 The dictionary becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     gif.= tes.=: A+ or B+ or C+;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     blo.=: BB+ or BF+;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =t: A-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =ty: B- or BB-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =ter: C-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =fu: BF-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

The observed pair probabilities become: 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(A) = p(gif,t) + p(tes,t) = 2/11 = p(B) = p(gif,ty) + p(tes,ty) 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(C) = p(gif,ter) + p(tes,ter) = 3/11
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(BB) = p(blo,ty) = 3/11
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(BF) = p(blo,fu) = 1/11
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So the observed entropy is now
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{red1.}=-\frac{4}{11}\log_{2}\frac{2}{11}-\frac{6}{11}\log_{2}\frac{3}{11}-\frac{1}{11}\log_{2}\frac{1}{11}=2.231270
\]

\end_inset

The generated entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}=\log_{2}5=2.321928$
\end_inset

.
 The difference is 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}-h^{obs}=0.090658.$
\end_inset

 This clearly brings the entropy closer to the theoretical (equidistributional)
 maximum; the grouping goes.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{lang}=\log_{2}8=3$
\end_inset

 as before, since the generated language still has 8 words in it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Case 2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Group gif.= and blo.= together.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\{\mbox{gif.=, blo.=}\}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the link types GB and BB can be consolidated, because they share the
 common suffix =ty: B={GB,BB}.
 No other link consolidation is possible, without permitting impermissible
 (previously unseen) linkages.
 The dictionary becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     gif.= blo.=: GA+ or B+ or GC+ or BF+;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     tes.=: TA+ or TB+ or TC+;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =t: GA- or TA-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =ty: B- or TB-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =ter: GC- or TC-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =fu: BF-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

Note that this dictionary does allow several previously unobserved words:
 giffu, blot, bloter.
 This is what happens when one hypothesizes unions between classes that
 merely overlap, instead of being subsets.
 What happens next depends on whether the overlap was large, or small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observed pair probabilities become: 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(GA) = p(gif,t) = 1/11 = p(GC) = p(TA) = p(TB) 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(TC) = p(tes,ter) = 2/11
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(B) = p(gif,ty) + p(blo,ty) = 4/11
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(BF) = p(blo,fu) = 1/11
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So the observed entropy is now
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{red2.}=-\frac{5}{11}\log_{2}\frac{1}{11}-\frac{2}{11}\log_{2}\frac{2}{11}-\frac{4}{11}\log_{2}\frac{4}{11}=2.550341
\]

\end_inset

The generated entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}=\log_{2}7=2.807355$
\end_inset

.
 The difference is 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}-h^{obs}=0.257014$
\end_inset

.
 The entropy is not getting closer to the equidistributional maximum; this
 grammar is rejected.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Case 3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Group =t and =ty together.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=\{\mbox{=t, =ty}\}$

 Then we may group G={GA, GB} and T={TA, TB}.

\end_inset

Curiously, this entropy is identical to the completely different case 2.
 The equidistributional entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}=\log_{2}7=2.807355$
\end_inset

 and the difference is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}-h^{obs}=0.257014$
\end_inset

 which is sharply further away from the equidistributional maximum.
 Thus, this grouping is rejected.
 This is perhaps surprising ...
 First, this grammar did not generate any new unobserved words; thus, it
 is a faithful grammar.
 Also, it suceeds in reducing the total number of link-types, and thus is
 naively acceptable for that reason.
 However, the frequency distribution of th generated grammar move away from
 the observed frequency distribution, leading to the rejection.
 This begs a question: when and how might we annotate the grammar with frequency
 information?

\end_inset

This is identical to the unreduced entropy: no surprise, because no link
 consolidation was performed.
 The equidistributional entropy is the same as well: 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}=\log_{2}8=3$
\end_inset

 since there are still 8 link types.
 The language entropy increased: there are now 11 possible words in the
 language, so 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{lang}=\log_{2}11=3.459432$
\end_inset

.
 This is a very unsatisfying situation: the difference in entropies is no
 better or worse than the starting point, and so this seems like a reasonable
 sideways slide, and yet, this grammar allows a bunch of nonsense words
 to be generated.
 That seems wrong.

Movement to Cases 1a, 1b and 1c are all blocked.
 This seems surprising.
 The relatively high-frequency observation of =ter makes the distribution
 of the consolidated grammar to deviate strongly from the distribution of
 the observed corpus.
 This seems like an undesired effect, as the point of learning how to simplify
 the grammar is to obtain a smaller grammar, rather than to preserve the
 the distribution of the corpus.
 Mostly.

\begin_layout Standard
Intuition suggests that the grammar for

 The grammar for quite rare cases should indeed be handled distinctly.
 To avoid this seemingly perverse outcome, perhaps the grammar should contain
 frequency information, which is to be consolidated appropriately.
 This is truly tedious, but seems to be neccessary.
 So we have to start from scratch.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Enumerate
Does the reduced entropy come closer to the Zipfian entropy?

 Does it also work for the simple case (with the original 7-word corpus)?

Never assume a uniform distribution of parts.
 This makes it very unlikely that an imprtant assemblage of parts can arise
 at random.
 For Adami, this is used to argue that biotic and abiotic strings should
 have very siilar distributions (or rather, the converse: a non-uniform
 abotic distribution makes it much more likely to find a replictor with
 a similar distribution.)

The information content of (grammatical sentences of length L is

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{total}$

 is the total number of sentences of length L, assuming a

 distribution of words picked from a vocabulary of D words.
 That is,

.
 But this is weird ...
 because the vocabulary isn't really a constant, and the natural distribution
 is not uniform, so its not clear what kind of
