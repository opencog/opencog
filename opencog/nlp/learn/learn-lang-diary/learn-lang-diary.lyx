 inducing synonymous words and phrases.
 The goal here is to unifiy into a consistent framework various techniques

\begin_layout Subsection*
Lexical Attraction, Mutual Information, Interaction Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this section is to clarify some of the formulas used by Deniz
 Yuret in his PhD thesis 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Discovery of Linguistic Relations Using Lexical Attraction
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, MIT 1998 (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://www2.denizyuret.com/pub/yuretphd.pdf"
target "http://www2.denizyuret.com/pub/yuretphd.pdf"

\end_inset

).
 These formulas are vitally important, because they provide a strong tool
 when working with text; this has been shown by Yuret in his thesis, as
 well as by many others, as well as by my own practical exprience with using
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Possibly the most useful formula is the one in the middle of page 40.
 By the time that we get to it, the terms 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mutual information
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lexical attraction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are being used interchangably.
 This formula states the 
\begin_inset Formula $MI(x,y)$
\end_inset

 for two words 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

; yet it is manifestly not symmetric in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, since 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the word on the left, and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is the word on the right.
 By constrast, textbook (wikipedia) definitions of MI are symmetric in thier
 variables.
 Below I try to dis-entangle the resulting confusion a bit, and give a more
 correct derivation of the formula.
 The key is to observe that the formula contains an implicit pair-wise relations
hip between two words, and that there are actually three variables: two
 words, and thier relationship.
 If this implicit relationship is made explicit, then the confusion evaporates.
 It also opens the door to talking about the MI (or the interaction information
 InI) of more complex relationships, not just pair-wise ones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being able to correctly write down the MI and the InI for complex relationships
 is important for NLP: relationtionships can be labelled by types (subject,
 object) and by word classes (noun, verb), and have various dependency constrain
ts between them.
 Thus, we need to be able to talk both about a labelled directed graph,
 and the entropy or mutual information contained in it's various sub-graphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In defense of Yuret, he does say, on page 22, that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lexical attraction is the likelihood of a syntactic relation.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 However, the relation starts becoming implicit by eqn 12 on page 29.
 An unexplained leap is then made from eqn 12 to the formula on page 40.
 The below gets fairly pedantic; this seems unavoidable to avoid confusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Definitions 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R(w_{l},w_{r}))$
\end_inset

 represent the probability (frequency) of observing two words, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 in some relationship or pattern 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 Typically, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 can be a (link-grammar) linkage of type 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 connecting word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 on the left to word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 on the right; implicitly, both 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 occur in the same sentence.
 The goal of this discussion is to enable relations 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 that are more general than this; for now, though, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is a word-pair occuring in a single sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest dependency grammar language model has only one type 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, the ANY type.
 This is the type that Yuret uses: it makes no distinction at all between
 subject, object relations (that is, all depdencies are unlabelled), and
 it does not make a head-dependent distinction (all dependencies are bi-directio
nal).
 Thus, in what follows, we do the same: initially, the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 is simply the statement that the words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 are connected by an unlabelled, un-directed edge.
 For this simplest case, what 
\begin_inset Formula $R(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 does is to capture that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 is to the left of 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In what follows, the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R=R(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 refers to a generic two-word relation, and not necessarily this simplest
 one.
 To regain Yuret's formula, use the simplest relation, the ordered word-pair
 relation, given just above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The quantity of interest is the (unconditional) probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R(w_{l},w_{r}),w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 of observing the two words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 in a relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R=R(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

.
 To correctly understand and work with this quantity, some care must be
 taken with the notation for several related probabilities.
 First, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w)$
\end_inset

, the probability of observing the word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 in the data sample.
 Next, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $P(S(w_{1},w_{2}),w_{1},w_{2})$
\end_inset

, the probability that the two words occur in the same sentence.
 Again, 
\begin_inset Formula $S(w_{1},w_{2})$
\end_inset

 denotes a relation between the two words; it differs from 
\begin_inset Formula $R(w_{1},w_{2})$
\end_inset

 in that the word-order does not matter.
 A third kind of pair relation is the unconditional probability of observing
 two words, which can be 
\emph on
defined
\emph default
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{1},w_{2})=P(w_{1})P(w_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, instead of assuming independence of two random variables,
 we define them to be so.
 This is possible, because we have a notation for specifying when there
 is a correlation.
 That is, if there was some correlation (relation) 
\begin_inset Formula $C(w_{1},w_{2})$
\end_inset

 between them, then one should write this explicitly, as 
\begin_inset Formula $P(C,w_{1},w_{2})=P(C(w_{1},w_{2}),w_{1},w_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 The notation here allows the various needed probabilities to be defined
 without ambiguity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, assumptions of independent variables are now replaced by a notational
 infrastrcture.
 Note, in particular, that if one uses a frequentist definition for the
 probabilities (as will be done in what follows), then the probabilities
 are not independent of the data sample from which they are drawn.
 Thus, all probabilities here have an implicit dependence on the data sample.
 This dependency is not explicitly shown.
 Some care must be taken to use the same data sample throughout.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above notation allows the definition of conditional probabilities, in
 the conventional sense.
 For example, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(R,w_{l},w_{r})=P(R|w_{l},w_{r})P(w_{l},w_{r})
\]

\end_inset

or that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(R|w_{l},w_{r})=\frac{P(R,w_{l},w_{r})}{P(w_{l},w_{r})}
\]

\end_inset

as the conditional probability of observing the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, given that it's component parts are observed.
 From the earlier definitions, the denominator factors, and so we conclude
 that the correct expression for the conditional probability is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(R|w_{l},w_{r})=\frac{P(R,w_{l},w_{r})}{P(w_{l})P(w_{r})}\label{eq:cond-pair}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is the probability of observing the relationship 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 given that the individual parts of the relationship have been observed.
 The relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 includes all correlations between the two words: thier ordering as well
 as thier co-occurance in a sentence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Take care, however: 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R|w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 is NOT the probability of seeing 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, given that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 occur in the same sentence.
 This would instead by given by 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R,w_{l},w_{r})/P(S,w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

.
 This is an entirely different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Frequentism - Counting words and pairs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to be usable, a computable definition for the probabilities must
 be given.
 For this, the definition can only be frequentist.
 That is, the probabilities are to be obtained from empircal data; from
 counting frequencies as they occur in data samples taken from nature.
 The frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w)$
\end_inset

 of observing a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is obvious: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(w)=\frac{N(w)}{N(*)}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w)$
\end_inset

 is the count of observing word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N(*)$
\end_inset

 is the total number of words observed.
 That is, by definition, it is the wild-card summation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N(*)=\sum_{w}N(w)
\]

\end_inset

How to count words is not entirely obvious, so even these defintions need
 care.
 There are several ways in which one can count words.
 One way is to simply count how many times a word occurs in the block of
 sample text.
 Another way is to count how many times a word occurs in parses of the sample
 text.
 These are not the same! For example, if a parse connects words by edges
 (by dependency-grammar relations), then one can count each word once, for
 each time that it occurs at the end of an edge.
 In this counting, the word-count is exactly double the word-pair count.
 A word is then counted multiple times, if it participates in multiple edges.
 If the sample text is parsed multiple times, then addtional counts can
 result that way.
 To maintain consistency with the defintions given in the previous section,
 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w)$
\end_inset

 is defined to be the number of times that the word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 occurs in the data sample, and independent of any other relations that
 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 might be engaged in.
 For now, it is assumed that the segmentation of the text sample into words
 is unambiguous.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $F(S(w),w)$
\end_inset

 be the number of times (frequency) of observing word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 in any sentence 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 This can be computed as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F(S,w)=\frac{N(w)}{NS}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w)$
\end_inset

 is the number of times a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 was observed in a data sample, and 
\begin_inset Formula $NS$
\end_inset

 is the number of sentences in that same sample.
 This counts with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

multiplicity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 can appear in a sentence more than once.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is not a probability, rather, it is an expectation value of the number
 of times that a word is observed.
 This can be made explicit, by writing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F(S,w)=\frac{N(w)}{N(*)}\,\frac{N(*)}{NS}=P(w)L(S)
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $L(S)=F(S,*)$
\end_inset

 being the average sentence length (the expectation value of the number
 of words in a sentence).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three different word-pair relationships are interesting.
 First, define the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $S(w_{1},w_{2})$
\end_inset

 as being the relation that both words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}$
\end_inset

 occur in the same sentence, but in arbitrary order.
 It is symmetric: 
\begin_inset Formula $S(w_{1},w_{2})=S(w_{2},w_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $A(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 as being the relation that both words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 occur in the same sentence, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 is to the left of 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}.$
\end_inset

 By this definition, the counts for the two are related: one has that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N(S,w_{1},w_{2})=N(A,w_{1},w_{2})+N(A,w_{2},w_{1})
\]

\end_inset

This is the symmetrized count.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neither of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is yet the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 mentioned above, which is defined as being the relation that both words
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 occur in the same sentence, that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 is to the left of 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

, and, most importantly, that there is a link-grammar link (of type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

R
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) connecting the two.
 Observe that although 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be deduced from 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, there is no simple or obvious relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

; these are essentially independent relations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way that the statistics are collected for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and for 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 are different.
 To count the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-type relations, one tokenizes a sentence into words, and then, counts every
 possible word-pair in the sentence.
 Effectively, one draws a clique of edges between the words, and then counts
 each edge.
 The statistics for 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 are collected by parsing the sentence into a random planar tree, and then
 counting the edges in the tree.
 The result for this counting is NOT the same as that for type-
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 edges.
 The reason for this is demonstrated in depth, in the section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Edge-counting"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "sec:Edge-counting"

\end_inset

, below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially, there is only one link relation 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

R
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between two words: this is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ANY
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 link-type.
 However, in general, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

R
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be other kinds of link-types.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

R
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can also have a head-tail dependency order: either 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 can be the head-word of a directional link.
 Thus, there are three different symmetrizations that can be obtained from
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

R
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: by failing to make a left-right distinction, by failing to make a head-tail
 distinction, and failing to do either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definition for the probability of observing a relation can be taken
 to be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(R,w_{l},w_{r})=\frac{N(R,w_{l},w_{r})}{N(R,*,*)}\label{eq:prob-relation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N(R,*,*)=\sum_{w_{l},w_{r}}N(R,w_{l},w_{r})
\]

\end_inset

This can be roughly understood as being the conditional probability of observing
 the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 between two specific words, given that the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 between any two words was seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it possible to define the unconditional probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R,*,*)$
\end_inset

 of seeing the relationship? The path to the answer is not entirely straight-for
ward.
 First consdier the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(S,w_{1},w_{2})$
\end_inset

 of seeing two words in the same sentence.
 This probability is defined just as in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:prob-relation"

\end_inset

; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(S,w_{1},w_{2})=N(S,w_{1},w_{2})/N(S,*,*)$
\end_inset

.
 From this, one can define the frequency of seeing a relation in a sentence,
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F(R|S,w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{P(R,w_{1},w_{2})}{P(S,w_{1},w_{2})}
\]

\end_inset

This gives the expectation value of seeing the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 in a sentence, given that the two words are already known to be in the
 sentence.
 That this is an expectation value should be clear, as the relation might
 appear multiple times in one sentence (e.g.
 if one of the words is repeated).
  The sum
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F(R|S,*,*)=\sum_{w_{l},w_{r}}F(R|S,w_{l},w_{r})
\]

\end_inset

then counts the average number of relations per sentence.
 For the any-type ordered-pair relation, clearly one must have that there
 are at least as many relations as there are words in the sentence, minus
 one, since each word must appear in at least one (distinct) relation.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $F(S,*)-1\le F(R|S,*,*)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $F(S,*)$
\end_inset

 the expected length of a sentence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, one can consider the ratio
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F(S,w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{P(S,w_{1},w_{2})}{P(w_{1})P(w_{2})}
\]

\end_inset

which captures the frequency at which two words are seen in the same sentence.
 The summation 
\begin_inset Formula $F(S,*,*)$
\end_inset

 then counts how many pairs are seen per sentence.
 Assuming that the counting was performed with a uniform distribution, this
 should then equal the number of edges in a clique.
 That is, for a sentence of length 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, there should be 
\begin_inset Formula $m(m-1)/2$
\end_inset

 word-pairs (edges) counted for that sentence.
 This should hold approximately, on average, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $F(S,*,*)\approx F(S,*)(F(S,*)-1)/2$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the development above, it should be clear that it is not really possible
 to define a quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R,*,*)$
\end_inset

 that is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

probability of seeing a relation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We can count the number 
\begin_inset Formula $N(R,*,*)$
\end_inset

 of times the relation occurs in a data sample.
 We can count the average number of times the relation is seen in a sentence.
 However, as long as the relation occurs at least once in the data sample,
 one would have to say that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

probability of seeing the relation in the data sample
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is one.
 The problem is one of normalization: there is no universe, of which 
\begin_inset Formula $N(R,*,*)$
\end_inset

 is a fractional measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, once can still consider an interesting ratio:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F(R,*,*)=\sum_{w_{l},w_{r}}F(R,w_{l},w_{r})=\sum_{w_{l},w_{r}}\frac{P(R,w_{l},w_{r})}{P(w_{l})P(w_{r})}
\]

\end_inset

This can be interpreted as a kind-of centrality.
 So, for example, for the any-pair relation, every word in the data sample
 must participate in at least one such pair-relation, and thus, we expect
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $F(R,*,*)\approx1$
\end_inset

.
 The precise value is related to the tree-parse that is being used to generate
 the any-relation.
 If the (random) parse-tree is acyclic, then the number of edges is comparable
 to the number of words.
 If the parse-tree contains cycles, then there may be more relations than
 there are words.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Yuret's Mutual Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Deniz Yuret introduces the concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lexical attraction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is reviewed breifly, here.
 He defines a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 of seeing an ordered pair; as compared to the above, the relation is implicit.
 To make it explicit, one should write: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(w_{l},w_{r})=P(A(w_{l},w_{r}),w_{l},w_{r})\label{eq:Yuret-prob}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which indicates the relation explicitly, as well as noting that the order
 of the positions in the relation matter.
 To avoid confusion, the cursive 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 is used for the Yuret notation, instead of the roman 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 which is reserved for the defintions above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The letter 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 used here reminds us that in Yuret's work, the pair-counting method used
 is the clique-edge-counting mechanism, described above, rather than the
 random-planar-tree relation.
 One expects the two to be similar, but not the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yuret also uses the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}(w_{l},*)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}(*,w_{r})$
\end_inset

 for wild-card summations, defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{P}(w_{l},*)=\sum_{w_{r}}\mathcal{P}(w_{l},w_{r})\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad\mathcal{P}(*,w_{r})=\sum_{w_{l}}\mathcal{P}(w_{l},w_{r})
\]

\end_inset

It is tempting to conflate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}(w_{l},*)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l})$
\end_inset

 but that would be wrong; not every possible word can occur on the 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 position.
 This suggests a different, but tempting, error, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}(w_{l},*)\le P(w_{l})$
\end_inset

.
 This is also not the case! A word might occur more frequently as the left
 side of a pair, than it does all by itself in the sample text.
 This follows from the frequentist definitions; the denominators for the
 two probabilities are not compatible; they do not range over the same universe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yuret defines the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lexical attraction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{MI}(w_{l},w_{r})=\log_{2}\,\frac{\mathcal{P}(w_{l},w_{r})}{\mathcal{P}(w_{l},*)\mathcal{P}(*,w_{r})}\label{eq:Yuret's MI}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

so that large positive MI is associated with words that rarely seen one
 without the other (e.g.
 '
\emph on
Northern Ireland
\emph default
' from his examples.) Note the absence of a minus sign in the above! See
 below for an explanation.
 Large-MI word pairs occur when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 is roughly comparable to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}(w,*)\approx\mathcal{P}(*,w)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth reviewing Yuret's example, at this point.
 He looks at the word pair 'Northern Ireland' and states (based on a particular
 corpus that was analyzed) that 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}P(\mbox{'Northern'})=12.60$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}P(\mbox{'Ireland'})=14.65$
\end_inset

 and finally that 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}\mathcal{P}(\mbox{'Northern'},\mbox{'Ireland'})=16.13$
\end_inset

.
 What these numbers mean is that although either word alone occurs at a
 rate of roughtly once in ten-thousand words, the word-pair together occurs
 at the rate of one in thirty-thousand or so: the word pair occurs almost
 as often as either word alone.
 Thus, the resulting MI is very large: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{MI}=-16.13+12.60+14.65=11.12$
\end_inset

.
 The choice of sign in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Yuret's MI"

\end_inset

 is such that words that co-occur have a large positive value.
 In practice, the distribution of the MI for word-pairs runs from about
 -15 to about +35, and, when ranked accoring to MI, the probabilites form
 a rounded mountain-peak, two-sided, each side being linear (Zipfian) with
 the peak at about MI=4 or 6.
 (See my other notes for a graph.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
1 January 2014
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, after that side distraction, which helped clear up notation, back to
 the main show ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main show is this: We want to model language, and specifically, find
 a 'minimal' set of relations R that are accurately generative.
 The meaning of 'minimal' seems obvious, intuitively, but a lot harder to
 pin down mathematically.
 We need to pin it down to get an algorithm that works in a trust-worthy,
 understandable fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So: what is the total space of relations, and how do we find it? The simplest
 model is then a Zipfian distribution of words, but placed in random order.
 This model has a total entropy of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=-\sum_{w}P(w)\log_{2}P(w)
\]

\end_inset

For a recent swipe at parsing a few hundred articles from the French wikipedia,
 I get H=7.2.
 This is on 17K words, observed a total of 35M times (actually, observerd
 each sentence 100 times, so really just 350K 'true' observations of words).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does one count the entropy of the rule-set? Elucidating this is the
 goal-set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But first, step back: describe the rules.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK ...
 so, once again ...
 sentence structure is to be described via link-grammar, using disjoined
 conjunctions of connectors.
 This is theoretically sound, as it seems to be isomorphic to categorical
 grammars (via type-theory of the connectors; need a formal proof of this
 someday, but for now it seems 'obvious').
 Also link-grammar is fully compatible with dependency grammar.
 So lets move forward.
 But this is an old debate, off to the side, immaterial for now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
How to count relations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a sentence with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 words in it, numbered 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n}$
\end_inset

 left to right.
 We want to constrain grammar by discovering a set of relations 
\begin_inset Formula $R(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n})$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(R(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n}))>0$
\end_inset

 when the sentence is gramatically valid (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 such an 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 exists), and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is zero when no such 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 exists (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 the sentence is not gramatically valid.) The first and most obvious simplificati
on rule is to observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 can be replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $R(W_{1},W_{2},\cdots,W_{n})$
\end_inset

 where each 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}$
\end_inset

 is a set of words.
 That is, instead of listing each sentences individually, we list certain
 classes of sentences.
 In other words, the relations 
\begin_inset Formula $R(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n})$
\end_inset

 are in one-to-one correspondance with a list of grammatical sentences 
\begin_inset Formula $(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n})$
\end_inset

, so simply listing all possible sentences is a very verbose way of specifying
 a grammar.
 It is linguistically 'obvious' that sentences fall into classes, and so
 the two relations 
\begin_inset Formula $R('this','is','a','dog')$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R('this','is','a','cat')$
\end_inset

 can be replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $R('this','is','a',W_{n})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{n}=\{'dog','cat'\}$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{n}$
\end_inset

 can be a rather large set of nouns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So ...
 the question is: what is the reduction of complexity, by performing this
 classification? What is the correct way of counting? I assume that 'complexity'
 is a synonym for 'entropy', so we are looking to do two things: enumerate
 the states of the system, and proivde a measure for complexity.
 So, lets consider a language with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 nouns, so that the cardinality of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{n}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $|W_{n}|=N$
\end_inset

 and the only valid sentences are 
\begin_inset Formula $('this','is','a',w)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in W_{n}$
\end_inset

 .
 Before simplification, we had 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 relations 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, one per sentence.
 We also had 
\begin_inset Formula $N+3$
\end_inset

 sets, each set containing a single word; the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 nouns, and the three words 
\begin_inset Formula $'this','is','a'$
\end_inset

.
 After simplification, we have one relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, and four sets; three of the sets have cardinality 1, the fourth set has
 cardinality 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Revision: July 2014
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There seem to be several ways of counting.
 Some of these seem to give wrong answers.
 Some just seem wrong.
 This is all very confusing, so I've altered the entries to explicitly show
 the different ways of counting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Method 1 (naive counting):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One counting rule is to count set-membership relations on equal footing
 with structural relations.
 Thus, before simplification, we had 
\begin_inset Formula $N+3$
\end_inset

 sets, each a singleton, and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $N+3$
\end_inset

 set membership relations.
 After simplification, we have four sets, but still have 
\begin_inset Formula $N+3$
\end_inset

 set membership relations.
 Thus, this particular simplification step does not reduce the number of
 membership relations at all.
 This seems disconcerting...
 Let's provisionally go with this and see what happens.
 Thus, before simplification, we had 
\begin_inset Formula $2N+3$
\end_inset

 relations grand-total, and afterwords, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $N+4$
\end_inset

 relations grand-total.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the correct 'thermodynamic' picture of what's going on? In this
 toy problem, we have a grand-total state space of size 
\begin_inset Formula $(N+3)^{4}$
\end_inset

 since any of the 
\begin_inset Formula $N+3$
\end_inset

 words can appear in any of the four slots in a four-word sentence (micro-canonn
ical ensemble).
 The entropy, at 'infinite temperature' where all possible four-word sequences
 occur with equal probability is then 
\begin_inset Formula $4\log_{2}(N+3)$
\end_inset

.
 The entropy of the set of grammatical sentences is 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

 since there are only 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 possible grammatical sentences.
 In this toy grammar, there are also invalid setences of length 1,2,3,5,6,7,...
 and so the total size of the space of word-sequences is clearly infinite.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so the space of word-sequences is very concrete, and easy to describe
 and measure, at least for toy grammars.
 What about the space of relations? Well, the claim is that the entropies
 of the before-and-after models are 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}(2N+3)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}(N+4)$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 Neither of these matches the entropy of the set of allowed sentences (which
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

), so this seems paradoxical, and begs the questions 'did we count correctly?'
 and 'did we actually simplify anything by making the above change of descriptio
n?' Hmm.
 The correct answer seems to be 'no' and 'no'.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Method 2 (subtract one):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To 'fix' the oddball results above, an alternative counting methodology
 is to subtract 1 from the cardinality of every set.
 This would then give both 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

 as the entropy for both the before and after relation-sets.
 Thus, before, we had 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 relations and 
\begin_inset Formula $N+3$
\end_inset

 sets, each of weight zero, for a total weighted-relation count of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 After, we have one relation and four sets; three of the sets have weight
 zero, one set has a weight of 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

 so the total weighted relations is again 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 This seems to resolve the paradox.
 But why subtract one? That's a bizarre rule, almost unheard-of in information
 theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Method 3 (naive log addition):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Total complexity is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K=\log_{2}|Rel|+\sum_{W\in Wrds}\log_{2}|W|
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Rel$
\end_inset

 is the set of relations, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Wrds$
\end_inset

 is the set of word-lists, and 
\begin_inset Formula $|W|$
\end_inset

 is the cardinality of each word-list.
 We then get, before simplification, 
\begin_inset Formula $|Rel|=N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $|W|=1$
\end_inset

 for each of the word-sets.
 The total complexity is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $K=\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

 as expected (i.e.
 equal to the log of the total number of possible sentences).
 After simplification, there is 
\begin_inset Formula $|Rel|=1$
\end_inset

 and 3 sets with 
\begin_inset Formula $|W|=1$
\end_inset

 and one set with 
\begin_inset Formula $|W|=N$
\end_inset

, thus yeilding a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $K=\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

 again.
 This seems to give a plausible answer, and provides a plausible argument.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Method 4 (relational complexity):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Treating each relation as being equally complex seems odd.
 It would seem to make more sense to have each relation contribute according
 to its complexity, so that the contribution of the relations to the total
 complexity is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{R\in Rel}C_{R}
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{R}$
\end_inset

 the complexity of each relation, itself the log of some measure.
 But how do we measure complexity? Is it Kolmogorov complexity? There's
 no obvious 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 defintion for this.
 The defintion of this complexity would seem to depend on the particular
 algorithm machinery of the grammar; that is, on the 'programming language'
 used to represent the relation.
 This is the traditional ambiguity attached to the Kolmogorov complexity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Method 5 (corpus distribution):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of measuring the complexity of a grammatical expression (in an as-yet
 unkown grammar), instead, use the corpus frequency ass a proxy.
 For the above example, if the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 sentences are equi-distributed (i.e.
 occur equally likely in the corpus), then, before simplification, each
 of the relations has a complexity 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{R}=-\frac{1}{N}\log_{2}\frac{1}{N}
\]

\end_inset

so that, before simplification, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K=\sum_{R\in Rel}C_{R}=\log_{2}N
\]

\end_inset

which again seems to be the desired answer.
 After simplification, there is one relation that applies to the entire
 corpus, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{R}=0$
\end_inset

 after simplification.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Method 6 (corpus word-counts):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we are taking word-relation frequencies from the corpus, then we should
 be taking word-set frequencies from the corpus as well.
 That is, the word-set contribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}|W|$
\end_inset

 is assuming an equi-distribution.
 This should be replaced by the corpus contribution 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\sum_{w\in W}p(w)\log_{2}p(w)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Summary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Provisionally, the last two methods seem to be the best way to move forward.
 To summarize, the complexity is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
K=-\sum_{R\in Rel}P_{R}\log_{2}P_{R}-\sum_{W\in Wrds}\ \sum_{w\in W}P_{w}\log_{2}P_{w}\label{eq:counting complexity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{R}=P(R)=P(R(W_{1},W_{2},\cdots,W_{n}))$
\end_inset

 is the probability of observing the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 in a sample corpus, and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{w}=P(w|W)$
\end_inset

 is the probability of observing word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 in the corpus, conditioned on its appearence in the corpus having to do
 with it belonging to the word-class 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Counting Link-Grammar Relations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Per link-grammar, each relation is decomposable into pair-wise relations;
 this is the so-called 'parse' of a sentence.
 If the relation is a single word-per-slot sentence relation, then the 'parse'
 is literal.
 We write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n})=\prod_{j,k,m}R_{\alpha}(w_{j},w_{k},t_{m})\ Q(R_{\alpha},R_{\beta},\cdots,R_{\omega})\label{eq:pair-decompose}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\alpha}(w_{j},w_{k},t_{m})$
\end_inset

 is a single connected pair of words, connected by the connector 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{m}$
\end_inset

.
 The product symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\prod$
\end_inset

 implies that all such binary relations must hold.
 The awkward 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(R_{\alpha},R_{\beta},\cdots,R_{\omega})$
\end_inset

 at the end is the additional no-links-cross constraint in the current link-gram
mar parser.
 Its a non-local constraint involving all of the binary relations.
 It also subsumes any 'post-processing' rules, although, for the language
 learnign exercise, there won't be any post-processing rules.
 At any rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is a place where higher ordrer constraints can be applied.
 In particular, the most genneral form for 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 should be 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(R_{\alpha},R_{\beta},\cdots,R_{\omega},w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n})$
\end_inset

 since, in principle, it could depend on the word-choice, although the no-links-
cross constraint does not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yuret proposes a way of discovering the pair-wise relations
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yuret1998"

\end_inset

.
 He makes the implicit, unvoiced assumption that there is a single, unique
 connector type 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{m}$
\end_inset

 for every ordered pair of words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j},w_{k}$
\end_inset

; that is, that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{m}=t_{m}(w_{j},w_{k})$
\end_inset

.
 Viz, specifically, that such connectors are in 1-1 correspondance with
 word-pairs.
 (I don't think he's aware of this assumption; I don't think anyone has
 ever before realized that he's making such an assumption; certainly, I
 haven't).
 Yuret then makes two claims: first, that the only possible grammatically
 correct parses are those of the above form (eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:pair-decompose"

\end_inset

) for which the relations 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\alpha}(w_{j},w_{k},t_{m}(w_{j},w_{k}))$
\end_inset

 have been previously observed; secondly, that there is a natural ranking
 of such allowed parses by summing the total mutual information associated
 with each word-pair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two concepts give rise to the idea of minimum-spanning-tree parsers.
 Such parsers work in a two-step process: a training phase, and a parse
 phase.
 In the training phase, one gathers a lot of statistics about mutual information.
 The important point here is that this is unsupervised training.
 To parse, one first creates a graph clique, with every word connected to
 every other.
 One uses the gathered MI to define graph edge lengths.
 Finally, the corrrect parse is then the maximum spanning tree of the graph
 (maximizing the MI, summed over the tree edges in the graph).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we use the same idea, but then take the next step.
 The spanning tree can be decomposed into a set of link-grammar disjuncts,
 one disjunct per word.
 The disjunct is merely a list of the connections that one word makes.
 It consists of the type, and the direction.
 The direction is left or right.
 The type is the 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{m}=t_{m}(w_{j},w_{k})$
\end_inset

 defined above.
 By parsing a large number of sentences, we can now automatically discover
 a large number of disjuncts, in an unsupervised manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal, the next step, is then to reduce the total number of disjuncts,
 and the total number of types, by clustering and discovering similarities.

 let it find its own way into the grammar.

The Boltzmann distribution is the so-called canonical distribution, meaning
 it maximizes entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of energy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Except for MaxEnt, the constraint is not on energy, but rather a set of
 constraints obtained on some other theoretical grounds.)

Boltzmann Entropy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the shanon entropy of the microcanonical ensemble: it maximizes the
 entropy (MaxEnt) for a fixed value of the energy.
 (MaxEnt: not the energy, but for a fixed set of constraints).
 (viz, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{B}=k_{B}\log\left(\epsilon\frac{d\Omega}{dE}\right)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 being number of states, E the energy, 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 a constant of dimension energy to make arg of the log dimensionless.) (MaxEnt:
 replace E by the individual constaints.
 This suggests that there are many Boltzmann entropies: one for each constraint
 that is applied!)

Gibbs Entropy

 For a non-sharp cutoff, the Shannon entropy is primal.).

Why does Yuret's MST work?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an interesting simplification that happens with minimum-spanning
 tree parsers driven by entropy.
 If we use Yuret's definition of the MI of word-pairs, then, Yuret says
 (I should re-read his stuff) that we should maximize the entropy 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{w_{l,}w_{r}}MI(w_{l},w_{r})\label{eq:MST entropy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Why? Why this, instead of the maybe 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more obviously correct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sum: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{w_{l,}w_{r}}P(w_{l},w_{r})MI(w_{l},w_{r})\label{eq:wrong MST entropy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

I think I can hand-wave the answer.
 The answer is that we don't really know the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
for the given sentence! 
\emph default
We know 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 for a large corpus, but its somewhat of a mistake to assume that this identical
 to what it would be for expressing a particular idea in a certain specific
 way.
 Its possible that, to express the idea, the only sentences that one could
 ever possibly use would have 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 that strongly deviate from a large-corpus average.
 Unfortunately, there is no easy way of knowing what this sentence-specific
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 is.
 So, instead we make the uniform distribution assumption, that they're all
 the same, and thus get eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:MST entropy"

\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:wrong MST entropy"

\end_inset

.
 Does Yuret ever make this argument himself? Dunno.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A supporting argument is that we also ignored 3,4,5-point interactions as
 well.
 Which brings us to the next point: why should we expect a link-parse to
 work better than an MST parse? Because Yuret-MST ignores the valence of
 words, whereas the disjuncts don't! The disjuncts provide a better, more
 accurate way of capturing valency!

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Of course, this is not really unsupervised, since it uses human-generated
 search patterns (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

such as
\begin_inset Quotes erd

) and also applies constraints (the targets must be proper nouns, which
 is not a-priori known).

\begin_layout Subsection*
Partition Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some notes about the Boltzmann distribution.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $F(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 be a numeric score associated with the edge 
\begin_inset Formula $(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 -- for example, this might be (minus) the MI.
 By convention, one introduces a Lagrange multiplier 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and writes 
\begin_inset Formula $F=\beta f$
\end_inset

.
 The probability of a parse tree 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 constructed solely out of edge-pairs is then defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(T|S)=\frac{\exp\left(-\beta\sum_{(w_{l},w_{r})\in T}f(w_{l},w_{r})\right)}{Z(S)}
\]

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is the sentence: a sequence of words, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z(S)$
\end_inset

 is the partition function: the sum of the probabilities of all different
 possible parses for that setence:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z(S)=\sum_{T}\exp\left(-\beta\sum_{(w_{l},w_{r})\in T}f(w_{l},w_{r})\right)
\]

\end_inset

The MST parse is then the single parse 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 that maximizes the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(T|S)$
\end_inset

 and this can be easily seen to be the parse that maximizes the sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{(w_{l},w_{r})\in T}f(w_{l},w_{r})$
\end_inset

 on the spanning tree 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Written in this form, it suggests how parsing can be generalized to include
 other scores.
 If, for example, one has some other score 
\begin_inset Formula $g(w_{1},w_{2},w_{3})$
\end_inset

 over triples of words, then one sums as above, using 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 in place of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 In general, one can consider scoring functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f=f(R;S)$
\end_inset

 for some relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 over the sentence 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 The prototypical example would be a scoring function that uses Link Grammar
 disjuncts for the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, together with some weighting for link lengths (so as to avoid long links),
 together with some weighting for word pairs (to give greater weight to
 idioms and set phrases, as opposed to grammatically valid but non-idiomatic
 parses).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many papers on supervised training, it is common to call the relation
 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and to consider many different possible features 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $f=f_{R}(S)$
\end_inset

 becomes a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{f}$
\end_inset

 over the features 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 The multiplier 
\begin_inset Formula $-\beta$
\end_inset

 is replaced by a vector of weights 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{w}$
\end_inset

, and so one considers the probability 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=\frac{\exp\left(\sum\vec{w}\cdot\vec{f}\right)}{Z(S)}
\]

\end_inset

Supervised training then uses a training corpus marked up with both a feature
 vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{f}$
\end_inset

 and the correct parse; training consists of using various supervised learning
 algos to find the best-possible weight vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{w}$
\end_inset

 that maximizes the fraction of correct parses (or optimizes the ROC curve,
 or other measure of accuracy).
 In unsupervised training, we don't have a training corpus, and thus, do
 not focus on optimizing the weight vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we do the funky chicken dance.
 Write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z(S)=\det\, L(S)
\]

\end_inset

This is commonly done when working with fermions; this is the Berezin determinan
t or Berezin integral, so named because one may write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det A=\int\exp\left[-\theta A\eta\right]d\theta d\eta
\]

\end_inset

for Grassman variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 a matrix.
 Here's the part that surprises me: Koo et al state that 
\begin_inset Formula $L(S)$
\end_inset

 can be taken to be a Laplacian matrix of a graph.
 Wow! The mind boggles.

Finding patterns

\begin_layout Standard
To problem.
 Consider an alphabet of 
\begin_inset Formula $N=5$
\end_inset

 letters, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\{A,B,C,D,E\}$
\end_inset

 and a corpus built from those letters.
 The five letters occur with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 Assume the corpus consists entirely of pairs AB, CB and DE, each occurring
 equally often: so: 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A,B)=p(C,B)=p(D,E)=1/3$
\end_inset

 .
 From this, we can reconstruct that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A)=p(C)=p(D)=p(E)=1/6$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(B)=1/3$
\end_inset

.
 This follows because the corpus can be reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $\{AB,CB,DE\}$
\end_inset

, so A occurs 1 out of 6 times, B two out of 6 times, etc.
 The total single-letter entropy is thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{SING} & =-\sum_{w\in\alpha}p(w)\log_{2}p(w)\\
 & =-\frac{4}{6}\log_{2}\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{3}\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}\\
 & =\frac{2}{3}-\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}=2.25163
\end{align*}

\end_inset

By contrast, in a random 2-letter corpus, we expect all possible letter
 pairs to occur equally often, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w)=1/5$
\end_inset

, which would result in 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{RAND}=-\log_{2}1/5=2.321928$
\end_inset

 and so we see that the total entropy for this corpus is less than the random
 corpus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total double-word entropy is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{PAIR} & =-\sum_{w_{1},w_{2}\in\alpha}p(w_{1},w_{2})\log_{2}p(w_{1},w_{2})\\
 & =-\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}=1.5849625
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Compare this to 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{PR-RAND}=-\log_{2}1/25=4.643856$
\end_inset

 for the random 2-letter corpus.
 The pair-entropy is sharply lower.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What do we know about mutual information? We can also deduce that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(*,B)=2/3$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A,*)=1/3$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
MI(A,B) & =\log_{2}p(A,B)-\log_{2}p(A,*)-\log_{2}p(*,B)\\
 & =\log_{2}3/2=0.585
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $MI(C,B)=MI(A,B)$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $MI(D,E)=\log_{2}3=1.585$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By contrast, in a random 2-letter corpus, we expect all possible letter
 pairs to occur equally often, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w_{1},w_{2})=1/25$
\end_inset

, which would result in an 
\begin_inset Formula $MI(w_{1},w_{2})=\log_{2}1=0$
\end_inset

 for all word pairs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given this corpus, we wish to deduce the following answer: there is a cluster
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\{A,C\}$
\end_inset

 and two link relations 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\gamma,B)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R(D,E)$
\end_inset

 occuring with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\gamma,B)=p(A,B)+p(C,B)=2/3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(D,E)=1/3$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\gamma,*)=p(A,*)+p(C,*)=2/3$
\end_inset

 so that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
MI(\gamma,B) & =\log_{2}p(\gamma,B)-\log_{2}p(\gamma,*)-\log_{2}p(*,B)\\
 & =\log_{2}3/2=0.585
\end{align*}

\end_inset

So how do we deduce this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, consider the reduced space, with 
\begin_inset Formula $N=4$
\end_inset

 letters: 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\{\gamma,B,D,E\}$
\end_inset

.
 In this space, only two pairs are observed in the corpus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $DE$
\end_inset

 with probabilities as above.
 The single-letter probabilities are 
\begin_inset Formula $p(D)=p(E)=1/6$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\gamma)=p(B)=1/3$
\end_inset

.
 The single-letter entropy is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{SING}^{red} & =-\sum_{w\in\beta}p(w)\log_{2}p(w)\\
 & =-\frac{2}{6}\log_{2}\frac{1}{6}-\frac{2}{3}\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}\\
 & =\frac{1}{3}-\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}=1.9182958
\end{align*}

\end_inset

This can be compared to the entropy of the random 4-word corpus: 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{RAND}^{red}=-\log_{2}1/4=2$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{RAND}^{red}-h_{SING}^{red}=0.081704>0.070298=h_{RAND}-h_{SING}
\]

\end_inset

In other words, the reduced corpus shows more order than the comparable
 unreduced corpus! Interesting! The above can be written as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{SING}-h_{SING}^{red}=0.333334>0.321928=h_{RAND}-h_{RAND}^{red}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What about the reduced pair entropy? For this case, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{PAIR}^{red} & =-\sum_{w_{1},w_{2}\in\beta}p(w_{1},w_{2})\log_{2}p(w_{1},w_{2})\\
 & =-\frac{2}{3}\log_{2}\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{3}\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}\\
 & =-\frac{2}{3}-\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}=0.9182958
\end{align*}

\end_inset

which can be compared to the random-pair entropy of 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{PR-RAND}^{red}=-\log_{2}1/16=4$
\end_inset

.
 The comparable reduction is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PR-RAND}^{red}-h_{PAIR}^{red}=3.081704>3.0588935=h_{PR-RAND}-h_{PAIR}
\]

\end_inset

So again, this wins, but not by a lot.
 Re-ordering, this can be written as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}-h_{PAIR}^{red}=0.6666667>0.643856=h_{PR-RAND}-h_{PR-RAND}^{red}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we seem to have two ways of winning: reducing the overall entropy, for
 for single letters, and for pairs, and also finding reductions that are
 strong, even compared to the reduced vocab.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Reductio ad absurdum? No.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What if we continue on this path, and (incorrectly) reduce to 
\begin_inset Formula $N=3$
\end_inset

 letters, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\{\gamma,\eta,D\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=\{B,E\}$
\end_inset

? Then 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\eta)=p(B)+p(E)=1/2$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{SING}^{rr} & =-\sum_{w\in\delta}p(w)\log_{2}p(w)\\
 & =-\frac{1}{6}\log_{2}\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{3}\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{2}\log_{2}\frac{1}{2}\\
 & =\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{2}\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}=1.4591479
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and the reduction inequality is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{SING}^{red}-h_{SING}^{rr}=0.4591479>0.4150375=h_{RAND}^{red}-h_{RAND}^{rr}
\]

\end_inset

So this inequality allows an inappropriate reduction to take place.
 That implies that we must not use the SING inequality to obtain reductions!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the pairs, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\gamma,\eta)=p(\gamma,B)=2/3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(D,\eta)=p(D,E)=1/3$
\end_inset

 and everything else being zero.
 Thus one gets:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{PAIR}^{rr} & =-\sum_{w_{1},w_{2}\in\delta}p(w_{1},w_{2})\log_{2}p(w_{1},w_{2})\\
 & =-\frac{2}{3}\log_{2}\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{3}\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}\\
 & =-\frac{2}{3}-\log_{2}\frac{1}{3}=0.9182958
\end{align*}

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{red}-h_{PAIR}^{rr}=0\ngtr0.830075=h_{PR-RAND}^{red}-h_{PR-RAND}^{rr}
\]

\end_inset

Here, nothing is gained, so the pair inequality blocks the inappropriate
 reduction.
 Consider a differnt inappropraite reduction to 
\begin_inset Formula $N=3$
\end_inset

: let 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=\{\zeta,B,E\}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=\{D,\gamma\}$
\end_inset

 Then the pair probabilities are 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\zeta,B)=p(\gamma,B)=2/3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\zeta,E)=p(D,E)=1/3$
\end_inset

 and again, there is no entropy reduction.
 The other groupings look to be equally ineffective.

OK, recast the above section for the (semi-)general case of word-pairs (not
 structures in general).
 So, given a vocabulary of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 words, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{RAND}=-\log_{2}\frac{1}{N}=\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{RAND}^{red}=\log_{2}(N-1)$
\end_inset

 so that for large 
\begin_inset Formula $N,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{RAND}-h_{RAND}^{red}=\log_{2}N/(N-1)=\log_{2}(1+1/(N-1))\approx1/N$
\end_inset

 and so we have a word-combine winner if we can combine words A and C into
 a cluster 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\{A,C\}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{N} & \lesssim h_{SING}-h_{SING}^{red}\\
 & =-\sum_{w\in\alpha}p(w)\log_{2}p(w)+\sum_{w\in\beta}p(w)\log_{2}p(w)\\
 & =-p(A)\log_{2}p(A)-p(C)\log_{2}p(C)+p(\gamma)\log_{2}p(\gamma)\\
 & =p(A)\log_{2}\left(1+\frac{p(C)}{p(A)}\right)+p(C)\log_{2}\left(1+\frac{p(A)}{p(C)}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\gamma)=p(A)+p(C)$
\end_inset

.
 What's not clear: is this inequality 
\emph on
ever
\emph default
 broken? Or does it always hold? At any rate, from the previous example,
 it seems clear that we should not use the SING inequalities to obtain clusters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For pairs, its clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{PR-RAND}-h_{PR-RAND}^{red}\approx2/N$
\end_inset

 which follows as above, given that 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{PR-RAND}=2\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

, etc.
 The corresponding inequality is now
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{2}{N}\lesssim & h_{PAIR}-h_{PAIR}^{red}\\
=-\sum_{w_{1},w_{2}\in\alpha} & p(w_{1},w_{2})\log_{2}p(w_{1},w_{2})+\sum_{w_{1},w_{2}\in\beta}p(w_{1},w_{2})\log_{2}p(w_{1},w_{2})\\
=-\sum_{w\in\alpha\backslash A,C} & \left[p(A,w)\log_{2}p(A,w)+p(C,w)\log_{2}p(C,w)-p(\gamma,w)\log_{2}p(\gamma,w)\right]\\
-\sum_{w\in\alpha\backslash A,C} & \left[p(w,A)\log_{2}p(w,A)+p(w,C)\log_{2}p(w,C)-p(w,\gamma)\log_{2}p(w,\gamma)\right]\\
 & -p(A,A)\log_{2}p(A,A)-p(C,A)\log_{2}p(C,A)+p(\gamma)\log_{2}p(\gamma)\\
 & -p(A,C)\log_{2}p(A,C)-p(C,C)\log_{2}p(C,C)
\end{align*}

\begin_layout Subsection*
Freedom and Constraint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concepts of freedom and constraint are central to the definition of
 algebra in mathematics.
 So for example, in group theory, the algebraic symbols denoting the elements
 of the group may be arranged freely, in any order desired.
 A given group is then defined as a 'presentation', a set of equivalences
 between different orderings.
 Thus, there is the notion of a 'free group', which is merely a set of symbols
 that can be written in arbitrary order, and no further constraints other
 than those of it being a group.
 Groups that aren't free are presented by a collection of equations, which
 state that one certain order of symbols is equivalent to another.
 One says that groups are 'equationally presented'.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more complex example is the term algebra, where the terms may be arranged
 in free order; but the combination of the written symbols on the page are
 constrained to those of the 'signature' of the algebra.
 One then has the notion of an 'equational theory', which is a term algebra
 with additional equations between expressions, indicating which expressions
 should be taken as equivalent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These have strong, and even precise analogues in linguistics.
 But first, continuing with the mathematical observations: the signature
 of a term algebra can be viewed as defining the 'syntax' of the symbolic
 notation: a Turing machine, tasked with the need to recognize the 'language'
 of the term algebra, would process input symbols one by one.
 It would appear that term algebras have a context-free syntax, and are
 thus recognizable by a push-down automata.
 That is, one must recognize the function symbol, the open and close parens,
 the commas separating arguments, and the constant symbols.
 The arbitrary-depth recursiveness is the only reason why the push-down
 is needed; otherwise the language seems 'almost regular'.
 (Hmm ...
 is there any formal definition/distinction of this case? i.e.
 for very simple constext-free languages, vs.
 'more complex' ones? Not that I know of ...)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In linguistics, similar notions of freedom and constraint arise, but seem
 to be more of a surprise and mystery to linguists.
 Thus, for example, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Anderson2012"

\end_inset

, Anderson describes the syntax and morphotactics of Kwakw’ala, a Wakashan
 language of coastal British Columbia.
 The syntax of the language (that is, the order in which the words can appear
 in a sentence) is very strict: the verb must be followed by a subject,
 optionally followed by the object, and then a prepositional phrase.
 Similarly adjectives must always preceed the noun.
 The language also has a rich morphology: words are assembled from stems
 and suffixes.
 The rules for assembling a word out of stems and affixes is refered to
 as the 'morphotactics'.
 In Kwakw’ala, it would appear that the morphotactics is utterly distinct
 from the syntax: here, object-denoting prefixes can preceed verbs, adjective-de
noting suffixes follow a noun.
 Anderson finds this quite remarkable: the language has two distinct kinds
 of structure-imposing systems: the syntax and the morphtactics, and they
 are quite different.
 He notes that this dual structure in turn allows the same thing to be said
 in multiple ways.
 One may take meaning-parts, as morphemes, and glue them together morphtacticall
y into words, and aranging these in a sentence.
 Allternately, one may take the meaning-parts separately, as individual
 words, and glue them together into a sentence, having a different sequence
 of the meaning-parts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The part that struck me with Anderson's analysis is the similarity of the
 phenomena to the analogous behaviour formalized in mathematics.
 Lets first look at a second example: Lithuanian has a rich morphotactical
 structure: verbs and adverbs are conjugated, nouns and adjectives are declined;
 the rules for doing so are rather fixed and uniform, making adjustments
 mostly for phonological reasons (i.e.
 with exceptions based on constraints that come from the natural flow of
 the sound sequences constrained by the use of vocal cords, mouth, tongue
 and lips).
 Curiously, Lithuanian is almost devoid of syntactic constraint: word-order
 can be chosen freely (in the mathemaitcal sense!), and the meaning of the
 resulting sentences are esentially the same (if I am allowed to gloss over
 the notion that different word orders can serve to highlight or emphasize
 different themes and rhemes).
 So again: a language with very distinct syntax and morphtactics; in this
 case, the syntax being almost absent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I used the theory of Link Grammar for performing structural linguistic analysis.
 The theory was originally developed to model syntactic structure, but it
 also appears to be entirely adequate for morphotactic analysis as well
 (certainly, for 'agglutinative' or 'concatenative' languages, with ongoing
 research into more complex morphologies).
 From the point of view of a linguist, Link Grammar appears to be 'just
 another theory of syntax', being a kind of dependency grammar.
 From the point of view of a mathematician, the situation is entirely more
 remarkable.
 It appears that the mathematical defintion of what constitutes a 'link
 grammar' is isomorphic to that of a 'categorical grammar', and that the
 correspondance is immediate and direct.
 Categorical grammars are interesting because they have a direct, formal
 mathematical definition that is studied and classified by mathematicians:
 roughly speaking, categorical grammars are 'non-symmetric compact closed
 monoidal categories'.
 The precise definition here has been championed by Bob Coecke ref [xxx]
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It takes some study of category theory to understand what this means, but,
 roughly speaking, it means that sequences of sounds, morphemes, words are
 analyzed in sequential order: by means of short-distance groupings of left-righ
t arrangements.
 This may sound silly, as, of course, sequential things occur in a sequence,
 but it helps highlight the difference between dependency grammars and phrase-st
ructure grammars, or computer-science grammars in general.
 An example of a 'computer-science grammar' is the so-called 'context-free
 grammar'.
 A hallmark of such grammars is that they allow recursion to arbitrary depths.
 An English-language example would be the sequence of sentences: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is a house
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This thing is a house.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This thing is a thing that is a house.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This thing is a thing that is a thing that is ...
 a house.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The example is silly because no one ever talks that way.
 The phrase-structure analysis of this would be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

(S (VP (NP (VP (NP ...
 )))))
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, with the heirarchical arrangement emphsized.
 Dependency grammars can also parse such sentences, but here, the arrangment
 of dependencies are in the form of arrows that point from head word to
 dependent word; the arrows are only rarely long-range, and usually point
 to the immediately-surrounding words.
 There is strong psycho-linguistic evidence for such local structure in
 language, see for example [xxxx].
 That is, the workings of the human mind is not recursive in nature, pushing
 and popping an arbitrarily deep stack as each new noun-phrase or verb-phrase
 is enountered.
 Indeed, psychological studies with constructed sentences similar to the
 above, but varying the 'thing' and 'house' at each depth, show that humans
 quickly loose track after just two or three nestings [need ref].
 In essence, the human mind is adapted for linear sequential analysis, and
 long-range order between words is challenging: this is the psycho-linguistic
 argument for dependency grammars.
 From the mathematical point of view, the statement is that human languages
 are not so much context-free, as they are non-symmetric compact closed
 monoidal categories.
 That Link Grammar is an example of the latter is why it seems so appropriate
 to use for syntactic and morpho-tactic structural analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which theories of langauge are mathematically isomorphic? That is, Link
 Grammar and categorical grammars seem to be isomorphic because there is
 a simple way of translating the one into the other, and vice-versa (although
 no formal mathematical proof of this has been written down).
 A mathematical proof of equivalence is a mechanical device: given one represent
ation, one turns a crank to obtain the other.
 More generally, its been argued that phrase-structure grammars and dependency
 grammars are equivalent in the same sense: there is an algorithm that converts
 the one into the other, and v.v.[where's the ref for this?].
 Does this mean that non-symmetric compact closed monoidal categories have
 context-free grammars as their internal language, and that every context-free
 language has a corresponding monoidal category? I think not, but the answer
 to that, the 'why not', and the 'what, then, is the difference?' is entirely
 unclear.
 Clarifying these relationships seems important for putting language study
 on a firmer basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, the point here was to clarify the boundaries between freedom and
 constraint.
 Traditional phrase-structure grammars were inspired by notions from 1960's-era
 computer science, but now seem slavishly wedded to the same ideas, to the
 detriment of closer linguistic understanding.
 Dependency grammars seem to be more psycho-linguistically valid, but have
 suffered from a lack of mathematical formalism that ellucidates freedom
 and constraint.
 This lack of formalism makes it hard to explain why some constructions
 are grammatically correct, and others are not.
 It also seems to draw an artificial and confusing line between syntactic
 and morphotactic structure, when, in fact, these really should be taken
 as a part of a continuum of structure.
 I see no reason why a single grammar could not also describe the allomorphic
 variations in pronunciation.
 After all, these are just a set of rules that govern how a morpheme is
 pronounced, and this is essentially a linear, sequential phenomenon, with
 only (mostly?) nearest-neighbor morphemes affecting one-another.
 The nearest-neighbor aspect of this fairly well screams out 'dependency'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another curious and interesting language-constraint structure emerges with
 the study of idioms and institutionalized, set phrases.
 Because these are 'phrases', built of 'words', it would naively seem that
 tese lie in the domain of syntax.
 But this is misleading.
 Institutionalized utterances are those where neither the word-choice nor
 the word-order are directly governed by syntax alone, but instead seem
 to be frozen into a fixed form.
 So, one talks of the 'time of day', but never of 'pressure of air' or 'height
 of mountain' -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What pressure of air should I put in this tire?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What height of mountain do you plan to climb?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What time of day do you expect to come over?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 There is nothing syntactic that prevents such a choice of wording, and
 the semantic meaning is more or less clear: its just that such word arrangement
s simply don't happen.
 Its as if the lexis for English has a phrase in it: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time-of-day
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which should be treated as a single word, rather than the three words
 it is written as.
 This provides the first hint of the role of probability in this discussion:
 the probability of seeing the phrase 'height of mountain' in English approaches
 zero: in fact, this text that you are reading right now just might be the
 only place ever in the history of the world in which this phrase has appeared
 ...
 despite it being 'grammatically valid'.
 Freedom and constraint aren't just governed by true-false distinctions,
 but by probabilities.
 The question then is, 'what is the most natural way in which to express
 such probabilities?' 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last is not just some idle intellectual question, but in fact, an engineerin
g question: the proper structure should have an immediate and direct effect
 on how well, and how quickly a language could be learned, via unsupervised
 machine-learning algorithms.
 A universal but naive attitude in the artificial-intelligence community
 is that 'oh.
 everything is a neural net, and we should use neural nets to build AI.'
 Less frequently, one may seem a similar attitude regarding Hidden Markov
 Models (HMMs).
 The fact that such naive approaches lead to algorithms that fail to converge
 quickly leads to ideas such as 'deep learning': a modification that explicitly
 splits a problem into layers, with explicit feedback between layers.
 Another variation used to escape the trap is to explicitly model what is
 un-known: this is the notion of maximum entropy (MaxEnt).
 Traditional AI was also founded on logic and reasoning, and, for many decades,
 AI was dominated by the exploration of boolean-valued logic.
 By this I mean anything with crisp, sharp truth values: whether first-order
 logic, boolean satisfiability, satisfiability-modulo-theories, stable-model
 semantics, and so on.
 Another corner was fuzzy logic, but that didn't seem to have legs.
 Notions of maximum entropy and probability can be unified: thus, one has
 Markov Logic Networks (MLN).
 What I'm wodering about here is that maybe none of these approaches are
 correct, because they are ignoring the actual structure that is in front
 of us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, perhaps, the correct approach is not to marry maximum entropy with first-ord
er logic, but to marry maximum entropy to dependency grammars (or, equivalently,
 to appropriate monoidal categories).
 The question then becomes: what is the appropriate monoidal category? Picking
 the wrong one will lead to disasterous machine learning performance (this,
 I think, is the lesson from neural networks).
 Picking something too easy doesn't get you far enough (the lesson of HMM's
 -- excellent for certain classes of problems, but lacking in scale).
 There are more choices than that: but the chices, and their inter-connectedness
, and trade-offs, seem to be unarticulated.
 For any given monoidal category, there would seem to be some probabilistic
 model corresponding to that category's internal langauge.
 That is, there is a way of describing the transition probabilities from
 state to state.
 Indeeded, (finite) monoidal categories, in the form of acts, can be partly
 understood to be finite state machines acting on a set.
 The probabilistic generalization of this leads both to probabilistic and
 quantum finite automata, with the former having a strong resemblance, if
 not identity, to Markov chains, with the corresponding acts being HMM's.
 My hypothesis is that probabilistic dependency grammars will lead to machine
 learning algos that converge more rapidly than the similar-but-different
 HMM that can also be mapped onto the same problem.
 Unfortunately, my hypothesis is impedded by my lack of understanding of
 precisely, exactly how the different approaches named above may be equivalent,
 isomorphic, or merely similar.

Link Grammar and Finite State Transducers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Claim: Finite state transducers, such as those used for morphological analysis,
 can be mapped to a Link Grammar.
 This implies that Link Grammar parsing can be used for morphological analysis,
 thus unifying syntactic parsing and morphological analysis into a unified
 framework.A finite state transducer (FST) is defined as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A set of states 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A transition function 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\subset Q\times(\Sigma\cup\{\epsilon\})\times(\Gamma\cup\{\epsilon\})\times Q$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A member 
\begin_inset Formula $(r,a,b,s)\in\delta$
\end_inset

 should be thought of as the arrow from state 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 to state 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, the arrow being taken when the input symbol is 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and as a result producing the output symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 The corresponding link-grammar dictionary entry for this would be 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     a.b: r- & s+;
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This states that no linkage is possible, unless the previous link resulted
 in the emission of the r+ connector.
 No transition to the next state is possible, unless that state has an s-
 connector on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current link-grammar notation a.b is awkward for printing, and perhaps
 some new style is needed to distinguish the output to be printed from the
 input that is recognized.
 Thus, perhaps, it would be better to invent a new notation, perhaps a$b
 to denote that a is recognized, and that b is printed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the above definition of link-grammar rules results in a very simple,
 linear linkage: state transitions follow one-another in linear order.
 Link grammar allows richer, more complex linkage diagrams, and so the question
 arises: can a given FST be compactified into a smaller system by making
 use of the richer possibilities that link-grammar offers? How can this
 compactification be acheived?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that the FST 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 includes as a subset the state transitions 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(r,a,?,s),(s,\epsilon,\epsilon,t),(s,b,?,t),(t,c,?,u)\}$
\end_inset

.
 The symbol ? is used here as a don't-care state, as it is irrelevant to
 the discussion that follows.
 The above state transitions indicates that when the system is in state
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, it may spontaneously transition to state 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, or may do so upon reading 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the presence of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is optional in the state transition.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 way of indicating this with link-grammar notation is using the link-grammar
 dictionary entries: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   a: r- & s+;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   b: t+;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   c: {t-} & s- & u+;
\end_layout

\end_inset

Because the transition 
\begin_inset Formula $(s,\epsilon,\epsilon,t)$
\end_inset

 reads no input, and produces no output, the state transitions would more
 likely be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(r,a,?,t),(r,a,?,s),(s,b,?,t),(t,c,?,u)\}$
\end_inset

, that is, by collapsing the transition 
\begin_inset Formula $(s,\epsilon,\epsilon,t)$
\end_inset

 into the prior state.
 This would have the entries
\end_layout

 This is to be done by entropy minimization, in two different ways: first,
 ENF reduces the total count of terms, for just one single expression.
 Second, and maybe more important: different words will share significant
 subsets of the ENF expression.
 So, for example, the LG English dicts define:

 the automated discovery of morpheme boundaries can be accomplished by searching
 for breaks between word-parts that have the lowest mutual information.
 Second, the discovery of morphotactics is identical to the discovery of
 syntax, as outlined above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest approach to finding the breaks between morphemes is to randomly
 break up words into two parts.
 A worked example of this is given below.
 Several questions present themselves:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To discover morphemes of words that split into three or more parts, is it
 better to always split pairwise, and then perform recursion, or is it easier
 to split into multiple parts immediately? Perhaps the answer is language-depend
ent?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does one obtain better mophological splits by immediately including morphtactic
 analysis, or can this be deferred?
\end_layout

Morphology Worked Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, this will be tedious, but I see no alternative.
 Suppose we have the corpus 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

test gift tester testy gifty tester gifter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tester
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 appears twice in the corpus.
 Explore all possible splits into two parts.
 The 4-letter splits split 3 ways, the 5-letter splits split 4 ways, etc.
 so there is a total of N(*,*)=3+3+5+4+4+5+5=29 pairs.
 All pairs appear once, except for tester, which appears twice.
 Viz.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
P(x,y)=1/29 for (x,y) in {(t,est), (te,st), (tes,t), (g,ift), (gi,ft), (gif,t),
 (t,esty), (te,sty), (tes,ty), (test,y), (g,ifty), (gi,fty), (gif,ty), (gift,y),
 (g,ifter), (gi,fter), (gif,ter), (gift,er), (gifte,r)}
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
P(x,y)=2/29 for (x,y) in {(t,ester), (te,ster), (tes,ter), (test,er), (teste,r)}
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

There is a bit of a procedural error in the above; we would like to discover
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

null suffix
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, that is, that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

test
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, with nothing following it, are morphemes, so that the possible suffixes
 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-y
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-er
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-nothing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, the above failed to count this possibility separately.
 Thus, given the above data, what we expect to find are two roots: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gif-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tes-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and three suffixes: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-t
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-ty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-ter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is not so bad.
 If we did split and count in such a way as to allow a null suffix, it would
 be ambiguus as to whether the stems end with a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

t
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or not.
 That is, the with-t and without-t stems would have been equally likely...
 Anyway, moving on...

Next, lets do the partial sums.
 Recall the notation for the partial summation of pairs.
 writing P(x,y) for the probability of observing the 
\emph on
ordered
\emph default
 pair of items (x,y), the partial sums are: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(x,*)=\sum_{y\in Y}P(x,y)
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(*,y)=\sum_{x\in X}P(x,y)
\]

\end_inset

 The left-hand sums are the column totals in the table above, table

Now, the compute the MI (we use log=log_2 in all cases below, for measuring
 the entropy in units of bits).
 Recall the definition of mutual information for 
\emph on
ordered
\emph default
 pairs, previously discussed and given above: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI(x,y)=\log_{2}\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x,*)P(*,y)}
\]

Phew.
 I think that's all of them.
 So, what can we conclude? The basic claim is that the morpheme boundaries
 occur at the places where the letters are the least sticky, the most likely
 to be de-correlated, i.e.
 those with the lowest MI.
 In the above, these are: MI(gif,ter)=1.69 followed by MI(tes,t)=MI(tes,ty)=1.86.
 These are the most likely splits for these three words.
 Lets look up each possible split, for each word.
 We get:

What looks like the best split has been found; it certainly matches what
 was expected.
 Yay! After this, link-type clustering proceeds just as before, as if these
 were distinct words.
 That is, the above has 6 distinct link types; clustering will then proceed
 discover one link type, between the cluster {gif, tes} and {t,ty,ter}.

That algorithm works only for concatenative languages, and does not provide
 a morphotactic structure; that is, it cannot learn the grammar governing
 the morphemes.
 It also requires several (plausable) assumptions about Bayesian priors.
 One assumption is that morpheme frequency follows a modified Zipfian distributi
on, this is used to make estimates for morphemes that are observed only
 once in the corpus.
 Another assumption is is that the morpheme length distribution can be approxima
ted by either a Poisson or a (two-parameter) gamma distribution.

This is inuitively obvious, because the morphemes obviously form a clique:
 each stem has been observed with each suffix.
 Technically, this is a bipartite clique or complete bipartite graph of
 order (2,3).
 Here, we see it immediately; however, in general, it is very hard to search
 for bipartite cliques in a grammar; general algorithms are provably NP-complete
 and run in exponential time.

h_{PAIR}^{observed} & =-\sum_{w_{1},w_{2}\in\alpha}p(w_{1},w_{2})\log_{2}p(w_{1},w_{2})\\
 & =-\frac{5}{7}\log_{2}\frac{1}{7}-\frac{2}{7}\log_{2}\frac{2}{7}=2.521641
\end{align*}

\end_inset

This is a bit of a misnomer, or misleading; we are actually computing the
 link-entropy: so the set is actually 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\{GA,GB,GC,TA,TB,TC\}$
\end_inset

 the first five of which were observed once, and the last was observed twice.
 So really we should write:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{observed}=-\sum_{t\in\beta}p(t)\log_{2}p(t)
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

 being the probability of observing link-type 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above is the observed entropy, given the corpus, and the grammar shown
 in listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:Morpheme-grammar"

\end_inset

.
 However, this grammar does not have any probability indicators attached
 to it, so that if it was used to generate a corpus, the entropy would be
 different.
 Basically, the probability of observing any of the link-types would be
 identical, and so the entropy would be:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{PAIR}^{generated} & =-\sum_{t\in\beta}p(t)\log_{2}p(t)\\
 & =-\frac{6}{6}\log_{2}\frac{1}{6}=2.584963
\end{align*}

\end_inset

This is obtained by observing that there are 6 link types in the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and so, if chosen equi-probably, the resulting entropy is just 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}6$
\end_inset

.
 For a given number 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 of link types, the entropy of the generated grammar will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

, for this extremely simply type of grammar, where all disjuncts have only
 one connector in them.
 The generated entropy will always be maximal for the grammar, as the observed
 distribution will surely never be equi-distributed.
 Thus, we have as a general principle:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h^{observed}\le h^{generated}
\]

\end_inset

Note that the equi-distributed link-types is the same as having each of
 the words in the corpus appear with equal frequency.
 The morphemes, however, do NOT appear with equally frequency (although
 individually, all stems do, and all suffixes do).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Link type reductions can be many ways.
 In each case, we look to see if adding a new word to a category improves
 the score.
 The possibilites are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group =ter and =ty together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group =ter and =t together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group =ty and =t together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group gif.= and tes.= together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this, we have more reductions:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.a.
 Add =t to {=ter, =ty}, and finally group together gif.= and tes.=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.b.
 Group together gif.= and tes.=, and finally, add =t to {=ter, =ty}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.a, 2.b.
 3.a 3.b variations of above
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.a.
 Group =ter and =ty together, then add =t.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.b.
 Group =ter and =t together, then add =ty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.c.
 Group =ty and =t together, then add =ter.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This gives 9 different orders in which the reductions can take place.
 Actually, only 6: case 1b and 4a are the same, as are 2b=4b and 3b=4c.
 Lets do at least some of them.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Case 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\{\mbox{=ter, =ty}\}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the link types GB and GC need to be consolidated: GG={GB, GC} and
 likewise TT={TB, TC}.
 The dictionary becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     gif.=: GA+ or GG+;

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =t: GA- or TA-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =ty =ter: GG- or TT-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

The observed pair probabilities become: 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(GA) = p(gif,t) = 1/7 = p(TA) = p(tes,t)
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(GG) = p(gif,ter) + p(gif,ty) = 2/7
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(TT) = p(tes,ter) + p(tes,ty) = 3/7
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So the observed entropy is now
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{red1.}=-\frac{2}{7}\log_{2}\frac{1}{7}-\frac{2}{7}\log_{2}\frac{2}{7}-\frac{3}{7}\log_{2}\frac{3}{7}=1.842371
\]

\end_inset

The generated entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{gen}^{red1.}=\log_{2}4=2$
\end_inset

 since there are four total link types in the reduced grammar.
 Pursuant to equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:counting complexity"

\end_inset

, we should add the log of the cardinality of the word-sets.
 Here, only one word-set has a cardinality greater than one: {=ty, =ter}.
 So, one gets:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{gen}^{wrds1.}=\log_{2}2=1
\]

\end_inset

The conditional entropy, based on the textual observations, is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{obs}^{wrds1.}=-\frac{3}{5}\log_{2}\frac{3}{5}-\frac{2}{5}\log_{2}\frac{2}{5}=0.970951
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Case 1.a.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\{\mbox{=ter, =ty, =t}\}$
\end_inset

 Then the link types GA and GG need to be consolidated: G={GA, GG} and likewise
 T={TA, TT}.
 The dictionary becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     gif.=: G+;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =t =ty =ter: G- or T-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

The observed pair probabilities become: 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(G) = p(gif,t) + p(gif,ty) + p(gif,ter) = 3/7
\begin_inset Newline newline

p(T) = p(tes,t) + p(tes,ty) + p(tes,ter) = 4/7
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So the observed entropy is now
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{red1.a.}=-\frac{3}{7}\log_{2}\frac{3}{7}-\frac{4}{7}\log_{2}\frac{4}{7}=0.985228
\]

\end_inset

The generated entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}2=1$
\end_inset

 since there are only two link types in the grammar.
 The word-counting entropy for the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 contributes an additional 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{gen}^{wrds1.a.}=\log_{2}3=1.584963
\]

\end_inset

while the observed entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{obs}^{wrds1.a.}=-\frac{4}{7}\log_{2}\frac{2}{7}-\frac{3}{7}\log_{2}\frac{3}{7}=1.556657

 The link types consolidate: EA={GA, TA} and EM={GG, TT}.
 The dictionary becomes

p(EM) = 5/7
\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_inset Newline newline

So that the entropy is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{red1.b.}=-\frac{2}{7}\log_{2}\frac{2}{7}-\frac{5}{7}\log_{2}\frac{5}{7}=0.863121
\]

\end_inset

The generated entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}2=1$
\end_inset

 since there are only two link types in the grammar.
 The word-set counting probability adds 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{gen}^{wrds.1.b.}=2\log_{2}2=2

\end_inset

 while the observed probabilities are
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Other cases.

\begin_layout Standard
Case 2.a.

\begin_layout Standard
Case 3.a.

Final Case.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(LL) = 7/7
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline

So that the entropy is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{final}=-\frac{7}{7}\log_{2}\frac{7}{7}=0
\]

\end_inset

The generated entropy is

 The word-set counting probability adds

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the above initial dictionary, we hope to deduce one word class that
 contains gif.= and tes.= and another that contains =t and =ter; eactly how
 the rest plays out is unclear.
 Lets begin by starting with the un-clustered entropy, and then see what
 hapens if we try various different clusters.
 So, as before, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\{GA,GB,GC,TA,TB,TC,BB,BF\}$
\end_inset

 and write:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
h_{PAIR}^{observed} & =-\sum_{t\in\beta}p(t)\log_{2}p(t)\\
 & =-\frac{6}{11}\log_{2}\frac{1}{11}-\frac{2}{11}\log_{2}\frac{2}{11}-\frac{3}{11}\log_{2}\frac{3}{11}\\
 & =2.845351
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

 being the probability of observing link-type 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Since there are 8 different link types, the generated entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{PAIR}^{generated}=\log_{2}8=3$
\end_inset

.
 The different between these two is 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}-h^{obs}=0.154649$
\end_inset

.
 The observed corpus also has 8 words in it (not counting multiplicity):
 this is by design; before reduction, there is always exactly one link type
 for each morpheme pair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets look at several cases:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group gif.= and tes.= together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group gif.= and blo.= together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group =t and =ty together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group =ty and =fu together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Group =ter and =fu together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we expect case 1 to go easily, cases 2 and 3 to to be ambiguous or
 blocked, case 4 to be weakly blocked, and case 5 to be strongly blocked.
 So, proceeding:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Case 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Group gif.= and tes.= together.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\{\mbox{gif.=, tes.=}\}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the link types G* and T* need to be consolidated: A={GA,TA} and likewise
 B={GB,TB} and C={GC,TC}.
 The dictionary becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     gif.= tes.=: A+ or B+ or C+;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     blo.=: BB+ or BF+;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =t: A-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =ty: B- or BB-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =ter: C-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =fu: BF-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

The observed pair probabilities become: 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(A) = p(gif,t) + p(tes,t) = 2/11 = p(B) = p(gif,ty) + p(tes,ty) 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(C) = p(gif,ter) + p(tes,ter) = 3/11
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(BB) = p(blo,ty) = 3/11
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(BF) = p(blo,fu) = 1/11
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So the observed entropy is now
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{red1.}=-\frac{4}{11}\log_{2}\frac{2}{11}-\frac{6}{11}\log_{2}\frac{3}{11}-\frac{1}{11}\log_{2}\frac{1}{11}=2.231270
\]

\end_inset

The generated entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}=\log_{2}5=2.321928$
\end_inset

.
 The difference is 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}-h^{obs}=0.090658.$
\end_inset

 This clearly brings the entropy closer to the theoretical (equidistributional)
 maximum; the grouping goes.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{lang}=\log_{2}8=3$
\end_inset

 as before, since the generated language still has 8 words in it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Case 2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Group gif.= and blo.= together.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\{\mbox{gif.=, blo.=}\}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the link types GB and BB can be consolidated, because they share the
 common suffix =ty: B={GB,BB}.
 No other link consolidation is possible, without permitting impermissible
 (previously unseen) linkages.
 The dictionary becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     gif.= blo.=: GA+ or B+ or GC+ or BF+;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     tes.=: TA+ or TB+ or TC+;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =t: GA- or TA-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =ty: B- or TB-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =ter: GC- or TC-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

     =fu: BF-;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

Note that this dictionary does allow several previously unobserved words:
 giffu, blot, bloter.
 This is what happens when one hypothesizes unions between classes that
 merely overlap, instead of being subsets.
 What happens next depends on whether the overlap was large, or small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observed pair probabilities become: 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(GA) = p(gif,t) = 1/11 = p(GC) = p(TA) = p(TB) 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(TC) = p(tes,ter) = 2/11
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(B) = p(gif,ty) + p(blo,ty) = 4/11
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p(BF) = p(blo,fu) = 1/11
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So the observed entropy is now
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{PAIR}^{red2.}=-\frac{5}{11}\log_{2}\frac{1}{11}-\frac{2}{11}\log_{2}\frac{2}{11}-\frac{4}{11}\log_{2}\frac{4}{11}=2.550341
\]

\end_inset

The generated entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}=\log_{2}7=2.807355$
\end_inset

.
 The difference is 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}-h^{obs}=0.257014$
\end_inset

.
 The entropy is not getting closer to the equidistributional maximum; this
 grammar is rejected.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Case 3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Group =t and =ty together.
 Let

\end_inset

Curiously, this entropy is identical to the completely different case 2.
 The equidistributional entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}=\log_{2}7=2.807355$
\end_inset

 and the difference is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}-h^{obs}=0.257014$
\end_inset

 which is sharply further away from the equidistributional maximum.
 Thus, this grouping is rejected.
 This is perhaps surprising ...
 First, this grammar did not generate any new unobserved words; thus, it
 is a faithful grammar.
 Also, it suceeds in reducing the total number of link-types, and thus is
 naively acceptable for that reason.
 However, the frequency distribution of th generated grammar move away from
 the observed frequency distribution, leading to the rejection.
 This begs a question: when and how might we annotate the grammar with frequency
 information?

\end_inset

This is identical to the unreduced entropy: no surprise, because no link
 consolidation was performed.
 The equidistributional entropy is the same as well: 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{gen}=\log_{2}8=3$
\end_inset

 since there are still 8 link types.
 The language entropy increased: there are now 11 possible words in the
 language, so 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{lang}=\log_{2}11=3.459432$
\end_inset

.
 This is a very unsatisfying situation: the difference in entropies is no
 better or worse than the starting point, and so this seems like a reasonable
 sideways slide, and yet, this grammar allows a bunch of nonsense words
 to be generated.
 That seems wrong.

Movement to Cases 1a, 1b and 1c are all blocked.
 This seems surprising.
 The relatively high-frequency observation of =ter makes the distribution
 of the consolidated grammar to deviate strongly from the distribution of
 the observed corpus.
 This seems like an undesired effect, as the point of learning how to simplify
 the grammar is to obtain a smaller grammar, rather than to preserve the
 the distribution of the corpus.
 Mostly.

\begin_layout Standard
Intuition suggests that the grammar for

 The grammar for quite rare cases should indeed be handled distinctly.
 To avoid this seemingly perverse outcome, perhaps the grammar should contain

 This is truly tedious, but seems to be neccessary.
 So we have to start from scratch.

There seem to be two different decision criteria to apply: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Does the reduced entropy come closer to the Zipfian entropy?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Does the reduced entropy increase, relative to the Zipfian entropy?

Never assume a uniform distribution of parts.
 This makes it very unlikely that an imprtant assemblage of parts can arise
 at random.
 For Adami, this is used to argue that biotic and abiotic strings should
 have very siilar distributions (or rather, the converse: a non-uniform
 abotic distribution makes it much more likely to find a replictor with
 a similar distribution.)

Thermodynamics with Continuous Information Flow
\begin_inset Quotes erd

xiv.org/pdf/1402.3276v3.pdf Jordan M.
 Horowitz and Massimiliano Esposito study the master equation for a probability
 p(x,y) over two distributions X,Y, which are connected via a bipartite
 graph.
 The total system is also connected to a thermal bath.
 The eqn is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dp(x,y)}{dt}=\sum_{x',y'}H_{x,x'}^{y,y'}p(x',y')-H_{x',x}^{y',y}p(x,y)
\]

\end_inset

i.e.
 its Markovian; we've written two indexes, which makes it clearer when H
 is bipartite i.e.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{x,x'}^{y,y'}=\begin{cases}
H_{x,x'}^{y} & \mbox{\ if\ }y=y'\\
H_{x}^{y,y'} & \mbox{\ if\ }x=x'\\
0 & \mbox{\ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

The interesting part is the entropy, and the thermal bath, which is not
 in the master eqn(!) The total entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{tot}=S_{XY}+S_{env}$
\end_inset

.
 Per usual, the information entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{XY}=-\sum_{x,y}p(x,y)\log p(x,y)$
\end_inset

.
 Two tricks now happen: (1) taking the timer derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{XY}$
\end_inset

 results in something that naturally splits into an X piece and a Y piece.
 Trick (2) is that 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{env}$
\end_inset

 cannot be written down directly, but its time derivative can be; it is
 proportional to the heat current: 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{S}_{env}=-\dot{Q}/T$
\end_inset

 Observer the tiny dot over S,Q these are the usuaul rate-of-change dots,
 (i.e.
 just rates, not functions we are taking time derivative of).
 Q is heat, Q-dot is heat flow, T is temp.
 Local detailed balance requires that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\log\frac{H_{x,x'}^{y,y'}}{H_{x',x}^{y',y}}=\frac{-(E_{x,y}-E_{x',y'})}{kT}
\]

\end_inset

is the change in energy due to a state transition: the change in energy
 is supplied by the heat reservior.
 Where does this mystery equation come from? Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Detailed balance requires that, when the system reaches equilibirum, that
 the transition rate into and out of the equlibrium state 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=\pi_{i}$
\end_inset

 are equal:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{ji}\pi_{i}=H_{ij}\pi{}_{j}
\]

\end_inset

(there is NO repeated-index summation).
 Then, just write 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{i}=\exp-E_{i}/kT$
\end_inset

, and turn the crank.
 The general principle: 
\emph on
the log of the ratio of the forward and backward transition rates between
 two states must be proportional to the energy difference between those
 states! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BTW the detailed-balance equation resembles Bayes Theorem, in that, if we
 wrote 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{ji}\rightarrow P(j|i)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{i}\rightarrow P(i)$
\end_inset

, then detailed balance is written as 
\begin_inset Formula $P(j|i)P(i)=P(i|j)P(j)$
\end_inset

.
 So the master equation describes

 Hmm.

 Anyway..

\begin_layout Standard
Key concepts: (*) monoidal categories are needed, and (*) symplectic geometry
 is needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Baez does the linear passive-component electronics example, viz a network
 of passive resistors, capacitors, inductors.
 For the resistor network, voltages at each node are taken from the field
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 while for the inductive network, the field is the field of rational functions
 of one variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}(t)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 time: i.e.
 voltage varying over time.
 A Dirichlet form is a quadratic form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}\frac{(\phi_{i}-\phi_{j})^{2}}{r_{ij}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is the reistance (impedance) between nodes i and j, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}=\phi(i)$
\end_inset

 is the voltage at node i.
 (Actually, we should be summing over edges, so as to handle parallel resistors).
 Note that the space of Dirichlet forms is smaller than the space of quadratic
 forms: Dirichlet forms do not have diagonal entries.
 Note that P is (half) the power dissipation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principle of least power dissipation is this: Given fixed voltages 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 on the boundary of the network, i.e.
 on the input/output terminals, the actual power dissipated is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q(\psi)=\min_{\phi\in\mathbb{R}^{N},\phi|_{\partial N}=\psi}\; P(\phi)
\]

\end_inset

Notation: there are N nodes, so voltages live in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{N}$
\end_inset

.
 The boundary of the network (input/output terminals) is written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial N$
\end_inset

 and the voltages are held fixed at the boundary.
 Note that Q is also a Dirichlet form.
 Viz its a map 
\begin_inset Formula $Q:\mathbb{R}^{\partial N}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The black-box principle of equvalent resistor networks is that any two
 resistor networks are black-box equivalent when they have the same Q.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the correct generalization to impedance, it is not enough to just replace
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}(t)$
\end_inset

 because this fails to deal with the time variation correctly.
 Put it another way: for the pure resistor network, we are free to fix voltages
 at both the input and output terminals arbitrarily; the internal currents
 are determined entirely by these.
 For the general case with impedance, we are not free to fix both voltages
 and currents at both the input and output terminals.
 Out of the total set of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\dim(\partial N)$
\end_inset

 voltages and currents, we can fix only half the set, i.e.
 a mixture of voltages, currents of 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim(\partial N)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To handle this, we need to construct a symplectic vector space, with a symplecti
c form on it, and work in the Lagrangian subspace of it.
 Thus, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\in\mathbb{F}^{\partial N}$
\end_inset

 as the potentials at the network terminals, and 
\begin_inset Formula $dQ_{\psi}\in\left(\mathbb{F}^{\partial N}\right)^{*}$
\end_inset

 as the conjugate currents.
 Out of the total space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}^{\partial N}\oplus\left(\mathbb{F}^{\partial N}\right)^{*}$
\end_inset

 of states, the subspace of actually attainable states is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\rm Graph}\left(dQ\right)=\left\{ \left(\psi,dQ_{\psi}\right)\vert\psi\in\mathbb{F}^{\partial N}\right\} \subseteq\mathbb{F}^{\partial N}\oplus\left(\mathbb{F}^{\partial N}\right)^{*}
\]

\end_inset

The set of Lagrangian subspaces is an algebraic variety, the Lagrangian
 Grassmanian.

Now that we have a database filled with disjunct statistics, how do we datamine
 that for grammatical categories, which is, after all, the main point of
 this exercise? Let me explain in several steps; at first illustrative,
 and then, more precisely.
 So first, consider a corpus containing these sentences:

\noindent
I want to conclude that "tree" is a lot like "bush", and the two should
 be considered as being "similar enough to be merged into a common grammatical
 category".
 That is, the words "tree" and "bush" always occur in similar contexts,
 or even the same contexts.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

context
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 here means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the dependency parse context
\begin_inset Quotes erd

the n-gram context

 More precisely, it means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the accumulated statistics for the disjuncts obtained from MST dependency
 parses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose the following parses were observed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that the above parses were obtained by performing a Maximum-Spanning-Tree
 (MST) parse based on word-pair mutual information (MI).
 The MST is obtained by considering the graph clique joining all words in
 the sentence, and then keeping only those edges that have the greatest
 MI between pairs of words.
 This is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yuret parse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The Yuret parse does not have labelled edges, and so we assign arbitrary
 (but unique!) link labels to the edges that were kept.
 Every unique word pair gets a unique link type.
 Then, using the standard Link Grammar theory, each link is broken into
 a + and a - connector, and the ordered set of connectors on a word are
 called a disjunct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The disjuncts extracted from the above parses would then be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	tree: (MA- & MB-) or (MC- & MD-)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	bush: (ME- & MF-) or (MG- & MH-)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No two disjuncts are alike, so naively, these seem completely uncomparable.
 Of course, this is wrong; we need to compare the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

decoded disjunct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

decoded disjunct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is NOT a part of the standard Link Grammar theory, so let me explain it
 here: it is simply the disjunct where the connector is replaced by the
 word or word-class that it connects to.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
MA-
\family default
 connects to the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, so the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

decoded connector
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for 
\family typewriter
MA-
\family default
 is 
\family typewriter
$the$-
\family default
.
 So, the decoded disjuncts are then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	tree: ($the$- & $big$-) or ($a$- & $green$-)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	bush: ($the$- & $big$-) or ($a$- & $green$-)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we can see that the decoded disjuncts are identical, for this example.
 Based on this, we conclude that perhaps

\end_inset

tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bush
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 indeed belong to the same grammatical category.
 The remainder of the clustering algorithm is now 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obvious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: rewrite the dictionary so that it has a single entry for both words:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	tree bush: (MA- & MB-) or (MC- & MD-)
\end_layout

\end_inset

This leaves the ME+, MF+, 
\emph on
etc
\emph default
.
 connector dangling: thus, we need to search for all occurances of ME+ and
 replace it by MA+, and likewise all occurances of MF+ need to be replaced
 by MB+, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Similarity metrics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above conveys the general idea, but is over-simplifies a few aspects.
 First of all, it is very unlikely that two words will appear in sentence
 contexts that are exactly identical.
 Secondly, some constructions may be very common, and others, very rare;
 that is, some disjuncts may be very common, and some very rare.
 So, for example: suppose we read a text which used the phrase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
the big idea
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a lot, but we also read an obscure linguistics text that said that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
a green idea sleeps furiously
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It would probably be a mistake to lump 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

idea
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tree, bush
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, given that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

green idea
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a very rare construction.
 Thus, we need a better way of comparing collections of disjuncts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One obvious way is to treat a collection of decoded disjuncts as a vector
 in a high-dimensional vector space.
 The similarity between two vectors could be given by the cosine between
 two vectors.
 Alternately, perhaps the vectors could be treated as points, and similarity
 be given by the distance between points.
 There are other possibilities; the best choice is not obvious; several
 need to be explored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, for example, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\{e_{1},e_{2},e_{3},\cdots\}$
\end_inset

 be the basis of a high-dimensional vector space.
 For the previous example, we let 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1}$
\end_inset

 correspond to the decoded disjunct 
\family typewriter
($the$- & $big$-)
\family default
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{2}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to 
\family typewriter
($a$- & $green$-)
\family default
.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is then some vector ...
 what vector should it be? There are several choices.
 Suppose that 
\family typewriter
($the$- & $big$-)
\family default
 was observed with a frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\family typewriter
($a$- & $green$-)
\family default
 was observed with frequncy 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The corresponding vector is then obviously 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}e_{1}+p_{2}e_{2}$
\end_inset

 and we can construct another vector that corresponds to the the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bush
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, say, for example: 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}e_{1}+q_{2}e_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dot-product between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bush
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is then given by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}q_{1}+p_{2}q_{2}$
\end_inset

, so that the larger the product, the closer the two words are.
 The cosine angle is 
\begin_inset Formula $(p_{1}q_{1}+p_{2}q_{2})/\left|p\right|\left|q\right|$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p\right|=\sqrt{p_{1}^{2}+p_{2}^{2}}$
\end_inset

 and so on.
 The closer that the cosine is to 1.0, the closer the two words are.
 There are other possibilities: we have the Cartesian distance 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dist(tree,bush)=\sqrt{(p_{1}-q_{1})^{2}+(p_{2}-q_{2})^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

 and we can contemplate 
\emph on
lp
\emph default
-metrics as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None of the above metrics take into account the mutual information (MI)
 of the disjunct.
 This is almost surely a mistake.
 Due to the vagaries of MST parsing, there will be many disjuncts with a
 low MI value.
 This is not uncommon in sentences with prepositions, where MST gives some
 poor choices for the links to the prepositions, and thus results in disjuncts
 with low MI values.
 Recall, the higher the MI, the stronger the structure is.
 Thus, perhaps a better vector for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
tree=e_{1}m_{1}p_{1}+e_{2}m_{2}p_{2}
\]

\end_inset

The above seems to be the most entropic-like in its expression.
 However, the probabilites might weight the terms too strongly, and so a
 weaker weighting would be the below.
 It is not yet clear to me which of these expressions are the most 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

elegant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or which work the best...
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
tree=e_{1}(m_{1}-\log_{2}p_{1})+e_{2}(m_{2}-\log_{2}p_{2})
\]

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}$
\end_inset

 are the mutual information of the disjuncts 
\family typewriter
(MA- & MB-)
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
(MC- & MD-)
\family default
, respectively.
 The last two seem to be closer to the intended spirit of the maximum entropy
 principle.
 There are even more possibilities, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Frequency and Mutual Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above section makes explicit use of the frequency and the mutual information
 of a disjunct.
 It is useful to define these.
 Given a disjunct 
\family typewriter
(MA- & MB-)
\family default
 let N
\family typewriter
(MA- & MB-)
\family default
 be the number of times that this disjunct has been observed.
 It will usually be an integer (except when obtained in certain unusual
 situations not discussed here).
 Let N
\family typewriter
(*- & *-)
\family default
 be the numer of times that any two-connector disjunct has been observed,
 as long as both connectors point in the - direction.
 That is,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N(*-\&*-)=\sum_{c_{1}\in-,c_{2}\in-}N(c_{1}\&c_{2})
\]

\end_inset

the summation taking place over all connectors in the - direction.
 The frequency of observing 
\family typewriter
(MA- & MB-)
\family default
 is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(MA-\&MB-)=\frac{N(MA-\&MB-)}{N(*-\&*-)}
\]

\end_inset

The mutual information associated with the disjunct is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m(MA-\&MB-)=\log_{2}\frac{p(MA-\&MB-)}{p(MA-\&*-)p(*-\&MB-)}
\]

\end_inset

The reason for this possibly unexpected form was developed earlier in this
 diary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Semantics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another interesting issue that arises in the above discussion:
 the problem of syntax-semantics correspondance.
 Consider, for example, the sentence 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the dog treed the squirrel
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Here the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used as a verb, meaning 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the dog chased the squirrel up into the tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Such sentences will cause the the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to accumulate disjuncts that the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bush
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will not have.
 Likewise, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
I'm bushed
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a verb usage that has no analogous 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 version.
 Thus, not only do the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bush
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 have different sets of disjuncts, but the differences are hiding semantic
 differences ...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several strategies that can be used to deal with this.
 More on this later.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Finding word pairs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need a good way of finding word-pairs that are likely to be related.
 I think that perhaps the pattern matcher may be ideal for this.
 Details are TBD...
 but the basic idea is that the hypergraph for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tree: (MA- & MB-)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is connected to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

big
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because MB- is connected to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

big
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

big
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is connected to other lg-connectors, which in turn are connected to other
 disjuncts, which are then connected to other words.
 Thus, we search the local neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which causes us to dsicover the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

big
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and then we search the neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

big
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to find candidates such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bush
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which might be comparable to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This search graph is not small, but it is not large: There may be thousands
 of words that are two hops away from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but not millions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are the things that need to be done:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 several determiners, several prepositions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Write code for creating grouping words into grammatical clusters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Pick the most promising metric, and start clustering in bulk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 5 requires writing a lot of code; it can all be written before the
 final metric has been determined.

Not LSA -- 1 July 2015
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NotLSA -- a way to do LSA-like things without actually using LSA (Latent
 Semantic Analysis).
 Two very low-brow approaches, maybe well-known in the industry; I have
 no idea.
 Both of these approaches attempt to automatically extract keywords from
 documents.
 What cool about this is that its ...
 unsupervised; requires no training, and is based on very simple, proven
 ideas.
 Obvious, even: compute the mutual information between pairs of things ...
 between words and documents, between words and word-pairs, etc.
 Heh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But how do we do this? How do we compute the MI between a page of text,
 and a word? No way to answer this without diving into the details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Text-keyword correlation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets take a text, say -- 1000 pages of ..
 something.
 Some corpus.
 We want to compute the mutual information between the page itself, and
 the words on the page.
 We do this by analogy to MI of word pairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Call the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th page 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Count the number of times that word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{m}$
\end_inset

 appears on this page; let this count be 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{mk}$
\end_inset

.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{m}=\sum_{k}N_{mk}$
\end_inset

 be the total number of times that the work 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{m}$
\end_inset

 appear in the document, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $N=\sum_{m}N_{m}$
\end_inset

 be the total number of words in the document.
 Then, as usual, define probabilities, so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{m}=P(w_{m})=N_{m}/N
\]

\end_inset

is the frequency of observing word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{m}$
\end_inset

 in the entire corpus, and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{mk}=P(w_{m}|g_{k})=N_{mk}/\sum_{m}N_{mk}
\]

\end_inset

be the (relative) frequency of the same word on page 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{mk}$
\end_inset

 is independent of the page size.
 Pages do not all have to be of the same size.
 Define the mutual information as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{MI}(g_{k},w_{m})=-\log_{2}\frac{p_{mk}}{p_{m}}=-\log_{2}\frac{N_{mk}N}{\sum_{m}N_{mk}\sum_{k}N_{mk}}=-\log_{2}\frac{p(m,k)}{p(m,*)p(*,k)}
\]

\end_inset

This is essentially a measure of how much more often the word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{m}$
\end_inset

 appears on page 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{k}$
\end_inset

 as compared to its usual frequency.
 The highest-MI words are essentially the topic words for the page.
 The right-most form introduces a new notation, to make it clear that it
 resembles the traditional pair-MI expression.
 The notation is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(m,k)=\frac{N_{mk}}{N}
\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(m,*)=\sum_{k}p(m,k)\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad p(*,k)=\sum_{m}p(m,k)
\]

\end_inset

are the traditional-looking pair-MI values.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TODO: -- this does not have the feature-reduction/word-combing aspects of
 LSA...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Variants
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of working with words, we could work with word-pairs, which is a
 stand-in for working with (named) entities.
 Thus, we can identify if a named entity occurs in a document more often
 than average.

What are the actual distributions, for these two cases? Begin by counting
 the number of planar trees.
 I currently do not know of any published work on this, so below, I make
 a half-baked attempt to count these myself.
 Its ...
 incomplete.
 Maybe there's some simpler approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Counting planar tree graphs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's count the number of planar tree graphs; i.e.
 those without any loops.
 First, we need a generic formula for sentences of length N.
 This is not so very easy.
 The diagram below shows one way to count.
 (I think what follows is correct, but I might be making a mistake.
 I am unaware of any literature that presents this information).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, the star represents some planar tree connecting all of the words of
 a smaller sentence.
 Assume that there are 
\begin_inset Formula $T(n)$
\end_inset

 such trees, connecting 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 words.
 Tree diagrams of of Type A are assembled by placing two adjacent smaller
 trees next to each other.
 Naively, one can then count how many such pairs there are; the issue is
 that the Type B diagram will occur mutiple times in this pairing; we would
 rather NOT count it with this mutiplicity.
 To avoid this problem, we should only allow pairs, such as Type A, to be
 assembled of sub-parts of the shapes C and D.
 Because of the over-arching arc, these can never result in double-counting.
 However, counting only pairs results in an under-counting: graphs of Type
 B never occur.
 Thus, one should count pairs, triples, and so on -- graphs of Type E.
 Now we have a way of getting the formula.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $D(n)$
\end_inset

 as the count of the number of planar trees, connecting 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 words, having an arc connecting the first and last word: i.e.
 trees of type C or D.
 (Think 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

D = dome
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) One then has that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D(n)=\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}T(j)T(n-j)
\]

\end_inset

It is convenient, here, to define 
\begin_inset Formula $T(1)=1$
\end_inset

.
 The first and last terms of this sum then correspond to trees of Type C,
 while the middle terms are trees of type D.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To count trees of Type E, is is convenient to break this up into the problem
 of counting chains of length 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, so that there are 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{k}(n)$
\end_inset

 trees, consisting of a sequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 domes, making up a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 words.
 One then has that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T(n)=D(n)+C_{2}(n)+\cdots+C_{n-1}(n)
\]

\end_inset

It's convenient, here, to define 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{1}(n)=D(n)$
\end_inset

.
 Writing down the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{k}(n)$
\end_inset

's requires some combinatorial magic.
 The first one is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{2}(n)=\sum_{j=2}^{n-1}D(j)D(n-j+1)
\]

\end_inset

Next comes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{3}(n)=\sum_{j=2}^{n-1}\;\sum_{m=2}^{n-j+1}D(j)D(m)D(n-j-m+2)
\]

\end_inset

which is awkward to write down.
 It's easier to count partitions of sets.
 Thus, what really is happening here is that the sums range over all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-way partitions of sets containing 
\begin_inset Formula $n+k-1$
\end_inset

 elements.
 Not the partition is NOT over 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 elements: to get connected graphs, we have to identify end-points of each
 link in the chain.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{k}(n)=\Pi_{\sigma}\cdots
\]

\end_inset

Either I am computing this wrong, or the sequences are not in OEIS.
 Surprising!

\begin_layout Subsection*
Counting planar loop graphs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above process can be repeated, except that this time, we consider the
 planar graphs containing loops.
 To get started, consider the diagram below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, the stars represent either 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

domed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 diagrams, or the empty set (a set containing no words and no edges.
 The type F concatenates two domes, and puts a dome over those, in turn.
 Since both of the stars are domed (or empty), it is impossible to add any
 additional edges to this graph.
 So, for graphs constructed out of a pair domes (one or both possibly empty),
 Type F is all that there is.
 For three domes in a row, there are only three ways of adding edges: these
 are shown in type G and H in this diagram.
 Again, this exhauses all possibilities.
 This process constructs both looped and tree diagrams.
 The general idea is to repeat this, for sequences of four or more stars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The counting is similar to that before.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $F(n)$
\end_inset

 count the number of domed graphs, connecting 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 words.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{2}(n)$
\end_inset

 count the number of type F graphs, made of two parts, and containing 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 words.
 Consulting the diagram, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{2}(n)=F(n-1)+\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}F(k)F(n-k+1)+F(n-1)
\]

\end_inset

Likewise, let 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{3}(n)$
\end_inset

 count the number of graphs of type G and H, combined.
 Consulting the diagram, this has a more complex expression:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{3}(n)=\sum_{k=2}^{n-2}F(k)F(n-k)+\sum\sum F()F()F()...+\sum_{k=2}^{n-2}F(k)F(n-k)+...
\]

\end_inset

The total number of domed graphs having 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 words is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F(n)=\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}G_{k}(n)
\]

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $S(n)$
\end_inset

 be the count of a string of domed graphs, but NOT having connecting arcs:
 that is, graphs of type A or E.

 It was collected over the course of a few days, and so should be considered
 to be a medium-sized sample: larger ones, collected over weeks or months,
 are possible, as well as smaller samples collected over a few hours.
 Note that the current atomspace infrastructure does have some serious performan
ce limitations: the atomspace is designed to be a very general-purpose hypergrap
h tool, and not a fast statistics-collecting tool.

Define the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $E(w_{1},w_{2})$
\end_inset

 as being the relation that both words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}$
\end_inset

 occur at the ends of an edge in the same sentence, but in arbitrary order.
 It is symmetric: 
\begin_inset Formula $E(w_{1},w_{2})=E(w_{2},w_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 By this definition, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N(E,w_{1},w_{2})=N(R,w_{1},w_{2})+N(R,w_{2},w_{1})
\]

\end_inset

This is the symmetrized count.
 It is useful to mod out one of the two words, and to consider the sum
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N(E,w)\equiv N(E,w,*)=\sum_{w_{2}}N(E,w,w_{2})
\]

\end_inset

This counts how often the word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 occurs at one end or the other of a word-pair.
 It is a distinct count from 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w)$
\end_inset

, which, by definition, counts only once per word in a sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Left-right asymmetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section explores how often a given word occurs on the left side of
 a word pair, vs.
 how often it occurs on the right.
 This, of course, depends on the word.
 If sentences and words were randomly generate, one would expect that a
 given word would occur on the left, or on the right, exactly half the time.
 That is, in a random world 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N(w,*)\approx N(*,w)
\]

\end_inset

Of course, this cannot hold for a given human language: the exclamation
 point, question mark and period occur exclusively on the right hand-side
 of any randomly-generated pair.
 This is not limited to punctuation: for Japanese, sentences usually end
 in a verb, and thus, for Japanse verbs 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, one expects that 
\begin_inset Formula $N(v,*)\ll N(*,v)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some typical values for English words are given in the table below.
 Here, by defintion, 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w)\equiv N(*,w)+N(*,w)$
\end_inset

 is the number of times the word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is observed in a pair relation.
 The word-pairs were generated by creating random parse trees of the sentences
 in the data-set, and then counting a pair, if two words are connected by
 a parse link.

A histogram summarizing the above table is shown below.
 It bin-counts the asymmetry 
\begin_inset Formula $N(*,w)-N(w,*)/N(w)$
\end_inset

.
 About 100 bins are used, from an observation of 8.88 million distinct English-la
nguage word pairs, where were observed for a total of 420 million times.
 These pairs connected about 400K distinct words.
 The number of distinct words is large, because these include surname, and
 geographical names, as well as an assortment of foreign-language words
 as might be encountered in a sampling of English wikipedia pages.
 (This is the dataset collected by Rohit, summer of 2015).

\begin_layout Section*
Connector Sets 7 May 2017 (revised July 2017)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a report on a dataset of disjuncts and connector sets, extracted
 from MST parses of a batch of sentences.
 First, a recap of what these are, then a characterization of the database
 contents, and finally, a report on the grammatical similarity of words
 in the dataset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
The errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original report, dated 7 May 2017, was prepared on a painfully small
 dataset, which also (may have?) incorporated a fatal bug in the disjunct
 code: disjuncts were being assembled incorrectly, due to a reversed sign
 in the MI calculations.
 This bug was eventually uncovered, and so it seemed best to entirely discard
 the initial analysis, and instead repeat it with a newer and larger dataset
 that was correctly assembled.
 The revised analysis was done mostly in July.
 Sadly, the discovery of this bug required that multiple large datasets
 be discarded and reconstructed.
 This caused a month of effort to be lost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simultaneously, there was a lot of confusion about the efficacy of the cosine
 similarity measure.
 Initial work on cosine similarity used a filtered dataset, with the goal
 of filtering to reduce 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the dataset, as well as to manage dataset size.
 It turns out that this filtering also had the undesired side-effect of
 destroying much of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

signal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as well -- it rendered many grammatically unrelated words to be judged
 to be very similar.
 Between the accidental sign reversal, and the excessively strong data cuts,
 it was all very confusing, and has taken another month to recover from
 this -- I'm back to where I was in May, just older and wiser, now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Summary of results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary results reported below are these:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* Most scores and metrics that can be assigned to connector sets give a
 (scale-free) Zipfian ranking distribution, and are thus fairly boring.
 Although there are some oddities here and there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* The greater the average number of observations per disjunct, the more
 grammatically acceptable (accurate) the disjunct seems to be.
 This is good news: it means that the general technique is not generating
 ungrammatical garbage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* Connector sets can be given a mutual information score.
 The distribution for the MI scores appears to be Gaussian (i.e.
 bell curve).
 This comes as a bit of a surprise.
 I am not aware of what kind of network theory gives a natural rise to Gaussians.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* The MI score seems to be quite good at identifying words that participate
 in idioms, set phrases and institutional phrases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* The average number of connectors per disjunct, which should have indicated
 the part-of-speech that the word belongs to, fails to do this.
 This seems to be due to the fact that the dataset is polluted with lists
 and tables (including tables-of-contents, and indexes), all of which are
 mis-interpreted as sentences by the processing software.
 This causes some very unusual disjuncts to be constructed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* In the earlier sample, derived from Wikipedia, it became clear that there
 were very few verbs that aren't relationship verbs.
 Wikipedia articles describe concepts and events.
 The relationship between these require the copula and other relationship
 verbs: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

has
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

was
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Wikipedia is almost completely devoid of narrative verbs: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ran
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

jumped
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thought
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

took
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Thus, we discern two very different styles of human communication: the
 exchange of facts, and the exchange of stories.
 Narratives contain a far richer selection of verbs, and thus, for language
 learning, a text corpus of narratives is required.
 Ideally, this would be from young-adult literature, which is a bit more
 direct in its kinesthetic content than adult literature might be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* Cosine similarity applied to connector sets seems to be an effective way
 of determining the grammatical similarity of words.
 Yet, it is not so unambiguously great, that other kinds of measures shouldn't
 be contemplated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Recap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The story so far: Starting from a large text corpus, the mutual information
 (MI) of word-pairs are counted.
 This MI is used to perform a maximum spanning-tree (MST) parse (of a different
 subset of) the corpus.
 From each parse, a pseudo-disjunct is extracted for each word.
 The pseudo-disjunct is like a real LG disjunct, except that each connector
 in the disjunct is the word at the far end of the link.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, for example, in in idealized world, the MST parse of the sentence "Ben
 ate pizza" would produce the parse Ben <--> ate <--> pizza and from this,
 we can extract the pseudo-disjunct (Ben- pizza+) on the word "ate".
 Similarly, the sentence "Ben puked pizza" should produce the disjunct (Ben-
 pizza+) on the word "puked".
 Since these two disjuncts are the same, we can conclude that the two words
 "ate" and "puked" are very similar to each other.
 Considering all of the other disjuncts that arise in this example, we can
 conclude that these are the only two words that are similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any given word will have many pseudo-disjuncts attached to it.
 Each disjunct has a count of the number of times it has been observed.
 Thus, this set of disjuncts can be imagined to be a vector in a high-dimensiona
l vector space, which each disjunct being a single basis element.
 The similarity of two words can be taken to be the cosine-similarity between
 the disjunct-vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equivalently, the set of disjuncts can be thought of as a weighted set:
 each disjunct has a weight, corresponding to the number of times it has
 been observed.
 A weighted set is more or less the same thing as a vector, and these two
 are treated as the same, in what follows.
 Note that the disjunct vectors are sparse: for any given word, almost all
 coefficients will have a count of zero.
 For example, the dataset that will be examined next has over a quarter
 of a million different pseudo-disjuncts in it; most words have fewer than
 a hundred disjuncts on them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some terminology and notation are introduced next, followed by a characterizatio
n of the dataset.
 This is followed by a statistical analysis of the word-disjunct pairs,
 and is followed by an analysis of the resulting word-similarity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Terminology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful to introduce some notation for counting words, disjuncts, and
 connectors.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w)$
\end_inset

 be the number of times that the word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 has been observed, in the dataset.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,d)$
\end_inset

 be the number of times that the disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 has been observed on word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 The pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(w,d)$
\end_inset

 is referred to as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

connector set
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cset
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the text below.
 Thus, for a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, there is a set 
\begin_inset Formula $(w,*)=\left\{ (w,d)|N(w,d)>0\right\} $
\end_inset

 of associated csets, called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

support
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the word.
 The size of this set can be written using the standard notation for set-sizes
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(w,*)\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, a disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, is supported by the set 
\begin_inset Formula $(*,d)=\left\{ (w,d)|N(w,d)>0\right\} $
\end_inset

 of associated csets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary contents of the database are the counts 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,d)$
\end_inset

 and everything else of interest in this section can be obtained from this.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,d)$
\end_inset

 can be understood as a matrix, where the disjuncts identify columns, and
 the words identify rows.
 In general, this is a very sparse matrix: the number of non-zero entries
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(*,*)\right|$
\end_inset

 is far less than the number of rows times the number of columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every time a word is observed in an MST parse, a disjunct is extracted for
 it; thus, word observations and disjunct observations are on one-to-one
 correspondence.
 In notation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{d}N(w,d)=N(w,*)=N(w)
\]

\end_inset

Similarly, the total number of times that a disjunct was observed is just
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N(*,d)=\sum_{w}N(w,d)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frequencies can be obtained by dividing by the total number of observations,
 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,d)=N(w,d)/N(*)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w)=N(w)/N(*)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $N(*)=\sum_{w}N(w)$
\end_inset

 the total number of observations of words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A single disjunct is always composed of a fixed number of connectors, independen
tly of any observations; let 
\begin_inset Formula $C(d,c)$
\end_inset

 be the number of times that connector 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 appears in disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $C(d,c)$
\end_inset

 is almost always either zero or one; however, a connector can appear more
 than once in a disjunct, so this count can rise to 2 or 3 or very rarely
 higher.
 The wild-card sum 
\begin_inset Formula $C(d,*)=\sum_{c}C(d,c)$
\end_inset

 is the total number of connectors in the disjunct; it is the vertex degree
 of all edges connecting to that disjunct.
 It is also useful to define 
\begin_inset Formula $C(d,+)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C(d,-)$
\end_inset

 as the total number of right-linking and left-linking connectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Dataset characterization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section was originally written in May 2017 and used to report data
 for a different dataset.
 However, a serious flaw was found in the code: all MI values had a minus
 sign in them, and thus all computed disjuncts were maximally-bad.
 The statistical analysis of this maximally-bad data wasn't horrible: it
 did behave reasonably.
 However, in the end, its still bad data, and so all charts and graphs are
 being revised with a new dataset.
 The old dataset was also terribly tiny.
 The new dataset is much larger.
 You can get the old version by digging in git, and pulling up commit 27a66643a5
2c0985adc5b38caf94fc25f5e2e684 (or maybe a bit earlier, circa late June
 2017 as that is when the bug was spotted.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following charts and analyses are derived from a single dataset, called
 'en_pairs_rfive_mtwo'.
 It contains data for word-pair statistics derived from parsing text from
 tranche-1,2,3,4,5 (See the download.sh scripts), followed by MST parsing
 of tranche-1 and 2.
 The word-pair statistics were obtained by applying random-tree parsing
 to entire sentences.
 The dataset is summarized in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sec:Dataset-report"

\end_inset

 and repeated here.
 The column labels are explained there.

\begin_layout Standard
The dataset contains 851964 words.
 Of these, 137078 words that have disjuncts attached to them.
 These words have been observed a total of 18489594  times, for an average
 of 18489594/137078 = 21.70 observations per word.
 This dataset contains 6239997 different, unique disjuncts, for an average
 of 18489594 / 6239997 = 2.963 observations per disjunct.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The period appears 849354.0 times, suggesting that this many sentences were
 observed.
 Each sentence thus has an average of 18489594 / 849354 = 21.77 words per
 sentence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dataset contains 6239997 unique connector-sets, for an average of 18489594
 / 6239997 = 2.96 observations per cset.
 This last number that makes this dataset feel thin and sparse.
 Its not clear how accurate that perception is: an earlier dataset was about
 one-tenth to one-twentieth the size, in the number of words, disjuncts
 and observations, yet it had a ratio of 1.5 observations per cset.
 That is, making more than ten times the number of observations only doubled
 the observations per cset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dataset is sparse in a completely different sense: viewing 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,d)$
\end_inset

 as a matrix whose size is 
\begin_inset Formula $851964\times6239997$
\end_inset

, but only a very small number of these is non-zero: this is 
\begin_inset Formula $8629163/(851964\times6239997)=1.623\times10^{-6}$
\end_inset

.
 The sparsity of this matrix can be defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}$
\end_inset

 of this number, which is 16.60.
 The sparsity appears to increase with the number of observations: the previous,
 ten-times-smaller dataset had a sparsity of 15.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total word-entropy for the dataset is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{word}=-\sum_{w}p(w)\log_{2}p(w)
\]

\end_inset

and was measured to be 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{word}=9.71$
\end_inset

 bits.

 functions in disjunct-stats.scm Alternately, the print-matrix-summary-report
 now reports this.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The total connector-set entropy is much larger.
 It is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{cset}=-\sum_{w,d}p(w,d)\log_{2}p(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

and is measured to be 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{cset}=20.96$
\end_inset

 bits.
 The disjunct entropy is dual to the word entropy:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{disjunct}=-\sum_{d}p(*,d)\log_{2}p(*,d)
\]

\end_inset

and is measured to be 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{disjunct}=19.14$
\end_inset

 bits.
 The total mutual information between the words and disjuncts is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{cset}=\sum_{w,d}p(w,d)\log_{2}\frac{p(w,d)}{p(*,d)p(w,*)}=H_{word}+H_{disjunct}-H_{cset}
\]

\end_inset

and is measured to be 
\begin_inset Formula $MI_{cset}=7.897$
\end_inset

 bits.

\begin_layout Standard
The first ten words in the word ranking are: "LEFT-WALL" "," "." "the" "and"
 "to" "of" "a" """ "in".
 This is the ranking of how often these words appear, overall, in the MST-parsed
 corpus.
 The number of connections to LEFT-WALL should be equal to the number of
 sentences in the corpus, as the parser is set up to make one LEFT-WALL
 connection to a sentence.
 Most sentences will end in a period; some with question marks of other
 punctuation.
 Commas and the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can appear more than once in a sentence.
 The frequent occurrence of the straight double-quote mark is due to the
 fact that the corpus is heavily weighted with dialog: i.e.
 with fictional novels, where the characters are speaking a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This list is repeated in the table below.
 The support is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(w,*)\right|$
\end_inset

, that is, the number of different kinds of disjuncts observed for that
 word.
 The count is 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,*)$
\end_inset

, that is, the total number of times those disjuncts have been observed
 for that word.
 The frequency is just the count divided by 18489594.
 The length is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{len}(w,*)=\sqrt{\sum_{d}N^{2}(w,d)}$
\end_inset

, that is, the root of the sum of the squares of the observations.

The main point of this table is to demonstrate the log-likelihood column.
 At this point, these numbers won't seem to have much meaning; however,
 they provide an overall scale that will be seen, repeatedly, in the analysis
 below.
 The range of magnitudes -- 4 to 7 -- is no accident, and similar ranges
 will be seen later.

\begin_layout Standard
The first ten pseudo-disjuncts in the disjunct-ranking are ""+" ",-" "the+"
 "He+" "The+" "the-" "LEFT-WALL-" "I+" "“+" "to-".
 The meaning of the plus and minus signs was explained above; but to recap:
 the disjunct 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

xxx+
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that there are many words that expect to be followed by the word
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

xxx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (on the right).
 The disjunct 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that there are many words that want to link to the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the left.
 This is grammatically correct: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a determiner, and it is always the dependent of some noun.
 The disjunct 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The+
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is at first appears to be grammatical garbage/nonsense: it states that
 there are many words that want to link to the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the right.
 Naively, this is never correct for English; determiners always precede
 the noun that they modify.
 The capitalization gives away what is really happening: the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a sentence opener, and it is being linked by the LEFT-WALL, indicating
 the start of the sentence; 
\emph on
ergo
\emph default
, it is lining backwards.
 Similar remarks apply to ""+" "the+" "He+" "I+" "“+": Clearly, the capitalized
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a sentence opener, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is plausibly so.
 The two different styles of quotation marks (symmetrically vertical and
 right-leaning) open up dialog in fictional novels, which make up a large
 portion of the corpus.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above avoids the question of whether its is syntactically correct to
 link the LEFT-WALL to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 This is determined not by raw frequency counts, but by mutual information.
 This is explored later.
 At this point we can only say that such a linking is frequent, and cannot
 judge whether it is correct.

 This was commented on before: the corpus has many novels, and so many sentences
 will begin with quotes.
 Next comes a period which links to a double-quote on it's right.
 Last comes period followed by a leaning double-quote.
 Clearly, this is expected in the corpus.

Not visible in the top-ten, but can be seen in the top-fifty are mirror-images,

and
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The counts differ: the sixth-place "and: ,-;" had 32755 counts, while 14th
 place had 17745.
 Presumably this is due the comma having a different or more complex linkage
 about half the time.
 Other items in the top-50 that are not sentence openers include "”: ?-;"
 ",: but+;" ".: him-; "in: the+;" ".: ’+;" "”: .-;" "of: the+;".
 The first disjunct with more than one connector in is is "It: LEFT-WALL-

It

 Not surprising.
 Proceeding down the list, the disjuncts continue in this manner.
 This does not necessarily mean that they are

high quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 It might be the case that the quality is given by the MI between the word

\begin_layout Standard
It is also interesting to turn the word distribution graph

.
 This is meant to be a simple exercise, so as to place some later graphs
 into context.
 Despite the simplicity, the analysis turns out to be somewhat surprising,
 and somewhat subtle.
 In particular, the last graph elicits some features in the dataset that
 are not otherwise easily visible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this dataset, there were 53076 words observed exactly once (out of a
 total of 18.5M observations of 137K words).
 This is quite something: of all the words observed, almost half were seen
 only once.
 More than half were seen twice, or less.
 These are presumably rare typos, foreign words, IPA pronunciation guides:
 any word that appears only once must be unusual; and yet, there are a lot
 of them! There are 17120 words that appear twice, 9081 that appear exactly
 3 times, 
\emph on
etc.

 These counts are graphed below.

This graph indicates that most (almost all) words were observed less than
 100 times.
 In this dataset, there were only 9425 words that were observed 100 or more
 times, 5683 words that were observed 200 or more times, and 3263 words
 that were observed 400 or more times.
 Percentage-wise: about 6.8% of the words were observed 100 times or more.
 This should be enough to give confidence in the syntactic usage of the
 commonly-used English words; but most of the rest of this dataset includes
 oddities of various sorts, including place names and given names.
 The challenge will be to see if these can be grouped into grammatical categorie
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 for the number of times that some word was observed, it appears that there
 are approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $53076\times N^{-3/2}$
\end_inset

 words observed that many times.
 In formulas, the size of the set of words 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ w|N(w)=N\right\} $
\end_inset

is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\left\{ w|N(w)=N\right\} \right|\sim N^{-3/2}\label{eq:word-distrib}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ w|\mbox{cond}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a set of words (subject to the condition cond) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\left\{ w|\mbox{cond}\right\} \right|$

 denotes the size of that set of words.

There is something interesting about this chart: it is more stable under
 varying dataset sizes than the Zipfian distribution.
 The slope of the Zipfian distribution changes, as datasets grow larger,
 typically trying to approach a slope of 1.0 very slowly.
 By contrast, the above 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{-3/2}$
\end_inset

 behavior seems to provide a much better description, even as the size of
 the dataset varies.
 I cannot demonstrate that assertion here, but have noticed it to be true
 when looking at other datasets.

The next graph belabors the point, and yet it's important.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Generated from binned-word-logli.dat
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It shows nothing new, but it does show it in a format that will be recur
 frequently, later.
 Thus, its worth understanding now.
 This graph shows exactly the same data as the previous graph: it 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 the same graph, except that the x-axis is now labeled differently, and
 some of the counts have been binned together.
 So first: note that 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}(1/18489594)=24.140$
\end_inset

 and so this is the location of the first spike on the far-right.
 Next, 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}(2/18489594)=23.140$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}(3/18489594)=22.555$
\end_inset

 are the locations of the second and third spikes: these correspond to words
 that have been observed 1,2 and 3 times.
 Words that have been observed exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 times will have a log-likelihood of 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}(N/18489594)=24.140-\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

.
 The formula 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:word-distrib"

\end_inset

, which was based on the graph above, can be rewritten as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\left\{ w|N(w)=N\right\} \right|\sim2^{-3/2\times\log_{2}N}
\]

\end_inset

which effectively predicts the height and location of the spikes.
 This is clearly demonstrated by the straight green line.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But then something else happens.
 As long as the bins are narrow, so that they are either full, or empty,
 then the nice power law holds.
 Once the bins become too wide to just hold single, discrete counts, but
 instead lump together different logli's, the apparent distribution changes.
 It is worthwhile to understand this phenomenon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This graph was generated by bin-counting.
 The x-axis was divided into 1200 equal-sized bins, and whenever the log-likelih
ood of a word landed within a particular bin, the count was accumulated
 into that bin.
 On the right side of the graph, many (most) bins are empty, because they
 do not correspond to logarithms of integers; this results in the spikes.
 The width of each bin is (24-9)/1200, and so when 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\log_{2}N-\log_{2}(N-1)\approx\log_{2}\left(1+\frac{1}{N}\right)\approx\frac{1}{N\log2}<\frac{24-9}{1200}=\frac{15}{1200}
\]

\end_inset

then multiple counts will be shoved into one bin.
 For this chart, this happens when 
\begin_inset Formula $N\approx115$
\end_inset

 so there are about 115 distinct spikes, and then they merge when the logli
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $24.140-\log_{2}115\approx17.3$
\end_inset

 which is the spot where the above graph bends from the green line to the
 blue line.
 From this point on, when multiple counts are being jammed into one bin,
 we expect the distribution measure to be given by the Jacobian determinant
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant
\end_layout

\end_inset

 of the point measure.
 We can compute this explicitly.
 Changing notation slightly, write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C(N)=KN^{-3/2}
\]

\end_inset

for the number of words that were observed 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 times.
 This is the same formula as before.
 For this dataset, 
\begin_inset Formula $K=53076$
\end_inset

.
 The bincount at logli
\begin_inset Formula $=x$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{bincnt}(x)=\sum_{x\le\log_{2}\left(T/N\right)\le x+\epsilon}C(N)\Delta N
\]

\end_inset

For this dataset, 
\begin_inset Formula $T=18489594$
\end_inset

.
 The binsize used in the above graph was 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=15/1200=1/80$
\end_inset

.
 In the above formula, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta N=1$
\end_inset

 is a notational trick to allow us to convert the sum into an integral when
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 gets large.
 We replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\int$
\end_inset

 and replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta N$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $dN$
\end_inset

 and write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{bincnt}(x)\approx\int_{x}^{x+\epsilon}C(N)\frac{dN}{dy}dy
\]

\end_inset

Here, there is a change-of-variable to 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\log_{2}\left(T/N\right)$
\end_inset

 or equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $N=T2^{-y}$
\end_inset

.
 The Jacobian determinant is then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|dN/dy\right|=N\log2$
\end_inset

 and so
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{bincnt}(x)\approx\frac{K\log2}{\epsilon\sqrt{T}}2^{x/2}
\]

\end_inset

Comparing this to the graph above, with logli
\begin_inset Formula $=x$
\end_inset

, we expect the bincounted region to have a slope of 0.5, and yet, the eyeballed
 fit above clearly shows 0.8.
 What's going on? WTF? Blame the data.
 Try again.
 The graph below shows exactly the same data, but this time there are only
 60 bins grand-total, and so only the first three spikes show.
 After that, the spikes merge together into bins.
 The green line is drawn exactly with the same slope and offset as before:
 that's because the first three spikes are in exactly the same locations
 as before, and have the same height.
 The blue line shows an eyeballed fit to the merged counts, and initially,
 it really does have a slope of 0.5, which is exactly what the Jacobian determina
nt was telling is it should be.
 Yayy! Declare victory and go home!

The purple line is an eyeballed fit to what the data is doing, when the
 number of observations really does become large.
 The knee in the graph is at about logli
\begin_inset Formula $=15.5=24.140-\log_{2}N$
\end_inset

 or, equivalently at 
\begin_inset Formula $N=400$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, we have to revise the apparent distribution.
 It is, for this dataset:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\left\{ w|N(w)=N\right\} \right|\sim\begin{cases}
N^{-3/2} & \mbox{for }N<400\\
N^{-1.8} & \mbox{for }N>400
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

It was noted before that there are 3263 words in the dataset that were observed
 400 or more times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does this mean? What is this saying? Its not entirely clear.
 It seems to suggest that there are about 3.3K words that are used preferentially
 more often than the rest.
 That is, they are used more often not only in absolute terms, but also
 in relative terms: the form a core of the vocabulary, enjoying a popularity
 exceeding the trend line for less-frequently used words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its not clear if this is a generic feature of the English language, or if
 this is peculiar to the particular corpus.
 Let's review the corpus again.
 The corpus comprises assorted late-19th and early 20th century texts from
 Project Gutenberg, a dozen sci-fi/fantasy novels, and a sampling of fan-fiction.
 These texts will contain stray markup, including tables of contents, chapter
 headings, indexes, figure captions and itemized lists.
 Quite often, ASCII artwork is used to delimit chapters or sections.
 Chapter headings are often written in all-upper-case.
 There are stray quotations in Latin, snippets of Latin prose and poetry.
 Travelogues will include miscellaneous foreign sayings and unusual place-names.
 All of this stuff adds up: it will be observed only once, twice, maybe
 a a few dozen times.
 It may as well be random text, from the point of view of the word-pair
 MI statistics, and from the point of view of the MST parser.
 There is no easy way to remove this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

garbage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in any 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 fashion.
 It is there, and it is unavoidable.
 It is indistinguishable from random sentences.
 However, it seems that the fact that some significant portion is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ungrammatical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should not affect word-count statistics, unless it just so happens that
 there is a core of 3.3K vocabulary words, followed by 130K words that are
 given names, arcane terms, and other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

junk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This does not seem plausible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, it is unclear on what the meaning of this knee in the graph really
 is, and how it should be explained.
 Note that this knee is NOT visible in the Zipfian distribution -- nothing
 happens at 
\begin_inset Formula $N=400$
\end_inset

 - it is smooth as silk.
 It maybe could have been visible in the

 graph, except that the far edge of that graph ends at exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $N=400$
\end_inset

, and does not continue past there! This seems to be a fairly subtle effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Ranked average observations per disjunct
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more interesting distribution arises by looking at the average number
 of observations per disjunct (per word).
 That is, a single word may have hundreds of disjuncts, observed thousands
 of times; what is the average number of times that a disjunct is observed?
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, it is explicitly meant 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,*)/\left|(w,*)\right|$
\end_inset

, the number of observations divided by the support for those observations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This number gives a hint of how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

narrow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the grammatical usage of a word is.
 If the average is high, it suggests that the word just does not have very
 many disjuncts on it; the few that it does have are observed a lot.
 Recall that these disjuncts (pseudo-disjuncts) connect to individual words,
 and not to word-classes.
 Thus, if a disjunct is seen a lot, it probably connects to another word,
 forming a high-MI pair.
 This can be explicitly seen in the example further below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A graph of the ranked average number of observations, per disjunct, per
 word, is shown on the left, below.

 The ranking is distinctly not Zipfian; this is confirmed by slicing the

 3263 words), excluding words with less than 100 observations (leaving 9425
 words), and excluding words with less than 20 observations (leaving 25505
 words out of 137K words).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graph on the right expresses an alternate view of the same idea: it
 shows a bin-count of all of the words.
 Reaffirming the graph on the left, it indicates that almost all words have
 an average disjunct observation count of less than four.
 It also conveys the sense that when the average disjunct count is greater
 than about four, that this is unusual, and perhaps meaningful in some way.

Closer examination indicates that more or less all words having an average

 The top six disjuncts are just single links, shown in the table below.
 Clearly all are princes.
 This leaves 767 other disjuncts with far fewer counts.

The skewness appears to be very sharp.
 This suggests that we should not waste time looking at mean-square variations
 in the average, although we'll do this anyway.
 But first, its worth graphing the skewness directly.
 Again, this is done on a log-log graph, in a Zipfian way.

Its kind of a strange graph.
 Yes, the x-axis of this graph does imply that there are thousands of words
 with more than a thousand disjuncts on them, and hundreds that have more
 than ten-thousand (unique, different) disjuncts on them! Exactly what does
 this mean? This is covered in the next section.

Disjunct Support Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it possible that some words have a large number of disjuncts on them?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes, it is.
 For example, the comma was observed to have 243987 unique, different disjuncts
 associated with it.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has 215324 unique, different disjuncts, the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has 126861.
 Rounding out this list are "to" "of" "." "a" "was" "LEFT-WALL".
 Its not clear what fraction of these disjuncts are grammatically valid,
 and what fraction are junk.

Terminology: the

support
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of a vector is the number of basis elements that have a non-zero coefficient.
 This is the set

 a word, when counted

 Here, the RMS size
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

length
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be used to describe the root-mean-square size of the set of disjuncts
 associated with a word.
 That is, each element of the set is a disjunct, and that disjunct has a
 count, the number of times it has been observed.
 The root-mean-square of these counts can be taken as the set-size.
 But this set can also be interpreted as a vector, and so the RMS size is
 the same thing as the Euclidean length of the vector.
 Thus, the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

length
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is sometimes used for the RMS size; they're the same thing.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is computed by taking the root-mean-square of the counts on each disjunct
 in the set, that is, by computing 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\sum_{d}N(w,d)^{2}}$
\end_inset

 for each word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 and then ranking.
 Interpreting 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 as a basis element of a vector space, this can be recognized as the Euclidean
 length of the count-vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RMS size of the set is thus larger not only when more disjuncts have
 been observed, but also when most of the observations are made of only
 a small handful of disjuncts.
 That is, the RMS size should be relatively larger, if the word is less
 grammatically flexible.
 So for example, prepositions tend to be very flexible; adjectives, not
 so much.
 Thus, we expect adjectives to appear higher-up on this ranking list, than
 the observation-based list.
 And this might be true, relatively, but certainly not true absolutely.

The first dozen words of the RMS-size-list are: "LEFT-WALL" "." "and" ","
 """ "”" "in" "to" "of" "“" "as" "the".
 Not that interesting: these are all words that were observed a lot in the
 text.
 The RMS size is dominated by the total number of observations of a word
 in text.
 In and of itself, its insufficient to indicate how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

concentrated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the disjuncts are, how grammatically narrow a word is.
 For this, some other quantity is needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slope appears to be exactly -1.0, continuing the scale-free trend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Mean-square to size ratio
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More interesting is the ratio of mean-square size to the total size.
 In formulas, by ranking according to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{d}N^{2}(w,d)}}{N(w,*)}=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{d}p^{2}(w,d)}}{p(w,*)}
\]

\end_inset

This seems like the interesting ratio, because the Zipf exponent of -0.65
 would be doubled, when working with mean-square sizes, thus making the
 two rankings comparable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Words high in this score will be words that have relatively few disjuncts
 on them, or at least, few that matter much, that rise above the level of
 noise.
 The first ten words on this list, excluding punctuation, and excluding
 all words with fewer than 100 observations: "It" "and" "but" "in" "Two"
 "as" "Notes" "not" "There" "Summary".
 A review of the input corpus shows that the word "Summary" appears in only
 one input text: Charles Darwin's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

On the Origin of Species
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and then only to indicate an actual summary! The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Notes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 appears in less than a dozen input texts, with almost every usage being
 formulaic and rigid.
 The grammatical usage of these two words in the input corpus is fairly
 constrained, and thus it is no surprise that these have relatively narrower
 disjunct distributions on them.
 
\end_layout

Excluding the capitalized words, and punctuation, in this list what remains
 is quite surprising.

It is surprising because, grammatically, we expect most of these words to
 have a large number of varied disjuncts attached to them.
 We expect them to be diffuse, not sharp: we expect that these would have
 a large number of observations smeared over a large variety of disjuncts,
 instead of having their weight concentrated in only a handful of disjuncts,
 the way that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 was, above.
 So what is going on, here?

Are there other interesting measures? One could contemplate the ratio of
 the mean-square size to the support 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{d}N(w,d)^{2}/\left|(w,*)\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Another possibility would be this, minus the average-squared, which would
 give the second moment, aka, the mean-square deviation from the average,
 specifically
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\sum_{d}N(w,d)^{2}}{\left|(w,*)\right|}-\left[\frac{N(w,*)}{\left|(w,*)\right|}\right]^{2}=\frac{1}{\left|(w,*)\right|}\sum_{d}\left[N(w,d)-\frac{N(w,*)}{\left|(w,*)\right|}\right]^{2}
\]

\end_inset

Neither of these variations seem promising; they seem to offer up more of
 the same, at least on this dataset.
 A larger and more refined dataset might reveal otherwise.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Mutual information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fractional mutual information
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for a pair is interesting to explore.
 Define this as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
MI_{pair}(w,d)=-\log_{2}\frac{p(w,d)}{p(w,*)p(*,d)}\label{eq:mi-word-disjunct}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fractional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that the total MI for the set of all pairs can be written
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{cset}=\sum_{w,d}p(w,d)MI_{pair}(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

Fractional MI is interesting because it usually has a reasonably nice distributi
on.
 For this particular dataset, it ranges from about -11 to +24.
 The distribution is shown in the graphs below.

These graphs are generated by computing the value for 
\begin_inset Formula $MI_{pair}(w,d)$
\end_inset

 for each of the 8629163 
\begin_inset Formula $(w,d)$
\end_inset

 pairs (aka 'connector sets'), and approximating it's distribution by bin
 counting.
 In each graph above, there are 200 bins, each of width of about 35/200,
 and each pair is assigned to one of the bins, according to it's MI value.
 The graph on the left then shows how many pairs there are in each bin.
 The graph on the left is similar, but not the same: it sums the frequencies
 for all the pairs in each bin.
 In formulas: the graph on the left shows the value of
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sizeof }\left\{ (w,d)|MI_{pair}(w,d)\mbox{ is in bin}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

while the graph on the right shows
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{MI_{pair}(w,d)\mbox{ is in bin}}p(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

where '
\begin_inset Formula $x\mbox{ is in bin}$
\end_inset

' simply means 
\begin_inset Formula $lo\le x<hi$
\end_inset

 with the bin being the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[lo,hi)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both of these graphs show 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

combs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the right side.
 These combs are exactly the same combs as noted in the last figure in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "logli distribution graph"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "logli distribution graph"

\end_inset

.
 The combs are due to the large number of words that have been observed
 only a small handful of times.
 In essence, the combs attest that the bulk of the high-MI pairs have been
 observed more than just a few times; 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 the high MI values are meaningful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both graphs show an eyeballed fit in green.
 The left graph shows that the distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian
 (visually a parabola, due to the logarithmic scale), given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-(0.23(MI_{pair}-11))^{2}/2$
\end_inset

.
 The shape of the graph on the right is harder to pin down.
 It has hints of parabolic behavior, yet the left edge appears more straight
 than curved, that is, to be exponential, given by 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{1.3MI_{pair}}=\exp0.9MI_{pair}$
\end_inset

.
 The eyeballed blue parabola is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-(0.15(MI_{pair}-12))^{2}/2$
\end_inset

, it's clearly missing a large excess in the middle of the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Marginal Mutual Information of Words
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The marginal mutual information of a single word can be defined by summing
 the (fractional) mutual information between a word, and all of it's disjuncts:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{word}(w)=\frac{1}{p(w)}\sum_{d}p(w,d)MI_{pair}(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

This is also written in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fractional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 style, so that, again, the total MI of the entire dataset can be written
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{cset}=\sum_{w}p(w)MI_{word}(w)
\]

\end_inset

That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $MI_{word}(w)$
\end_inset

 is the fractional contribution of the word to the total MI.
 The fractional marginal MI is very convenient for comparing different words,
 since it factors out the frequency of how often a word is observed: the
 MI of two words with two very different frequencies can be directly compared.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be seen from the graph below, the fractional marginal MI ranges between
 +3 and +18 for this dataset.
 The total MI for the dataset is measured to be 7.8969 bits.
 The distribution can be visualized in two different ways.
 The graph on the left, below
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is graphed by sorted-word-mi-hi-p in disjunct-stats.scm 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 shows the ranked MI of the 9425 words that have been observed more than
 100 times in this dataset.
 Note that it is a semi-log plot; it is NOT Zipfian.
 Note that the MI seems to decay logarithmically, for a good long ways,
 and then drops off a cliff.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graph on the right shows the distribution, for all 137078 words, bin-counted
 into 100 bins.
 The combs on the far right are again the same combs as noted in the last
 figure in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "logli distribution graph"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "logli distribution graph"

\end_inset

.
 The distribution appears to be Gaussian, and of approximately the same
 width as before, although located at a different center: the green line
 in the graph is the Gaussian given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-(0.24(MI_{word}-20))^{2}/2$
\end_inset

 as compared to 0.23 for the non-marginal MI distribution above.
 The difference between 0.24 and 0.23 seems to be significant: changing one
 to the other seems to give a noticeably poorer fit.

 few words in the ranking are: "LICENSE" "FULL" "formats" "BREACH" "AGREE"

 The word "LICENSE" is surely under-sampled, as, in this all-capitals form,

At the other extreme, the ten words with the lowest MI are: "it" "in" "of"
 "that" "to" "and" "the" "LEFT-WALL" "," "." ranging from 5.07 for "it" down
 to 3.33 for the period.
 These are already familiar from previous rankings: they occur with very
 high frequency; the disjunct lists on them will be lengthly variable, diffuse.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These samplings of disjuncts are sharply reminiscent of the technique of
 collocation used in corpus linguistics, but with a big, important difference.
 There, the linguist examines a window that is some 6-8 words wide, and
 examines the frequency of all phrases appearing within that window, containing
 the word-of-interest in the center.
 Here, we again have a word-of-interest, but this time, instead of seeing
 phrases, we see the grammatical structure revealed directly, by means of
 the disjuncts extracted from MST parses.
 The philosophical basis used to justify corpus linguistics, i.e.
 that of frequentism, is accepted and applied here as well.
 In this case, it is used to obtain grammatical structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Mutual information of disjuncts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Symmetrically, one also has the mutual information of a disjunct, in comparison
 to all of the words it connects to:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{disjunct}(d)=\frac{1}{p(*,d)}\sum_{w}p(w,d)MI_{pair}(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

Again, this is presented in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fractional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 style, so that the total MI of the entire dataset can be written as before:
\begin_inset Formula $MI=\sum_{d}p(*,d)MI_{disjunct}(d)$
\end_inset

The dataset contains 6239997 (6.24 million) unique disjuncts, observed for
 a total 18489594 (18.5 million) times.
 The distribution is shown below, with the disjuncts sorted into 200 equal-sized
 bins.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Fractional Entropy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a simpler variant than the mutual information, that is also worth
 understanding: the fractional contribution to the total entropy.
 This is given by the sum 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{word}(w)=-\frac{1}{p(w)}\sum_{d}p(w,d)\log_{2}p(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

This is written in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fractional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 style, so that the total entropy of the entire dataset can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{cset}=\sum_{w}p(w)H_{word}(w)
\]

\end_inset

 Analogously, one also has the fractional contribution of the disjuncts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{disjunct}(d)=-\frac{1}{p(*,d)}\sum_{w}p(w,d)\log_{2}p(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

where, again, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{cset}=\sum_{d}p(d)H_{disjunct}(d)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ranked fractional entropy is shown in the left graph below.

 It only shows those words that have been observed 100 times, or more.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It resembles the graph for the ranked fractional marginal MI, above.
 The graph on the right shows the distribution of the entropy, for all of
 the words.
 This affirms (or explains?) the sharp knee in the graph on the left: the
 knee occurs because almost all words have a large disjunct-entropy.
 Remarkably, the distribution is anti-Gaussian, in that it appears to diverge,
 the larger the entropy.
 In that respect, it cannot even be a proper distribution, as it cannot
 be normalized to a probability of 1.0 - the distribution increases without
 bound! Yet, as the graph illustrates, that is what it seems to be.
 The green curve is the anti-Gaussian, given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(0.27(FME-13.7))^{2}/2$
\end_inset

.
 As before, it has a width of approximately 1/4th.

The top-ranked words (which have been observed 100 times or more) are "clawing"
 "manages" "noting" "anyways" "circling" "choke" "neared" "urging" "pursuing"
 "exited".
 This is not a list that has been exposed with other statistics.
 Almost all of these are verbs, a grammatical class that never appeared
 in any of the previous lists.
 Why these? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these words have an entropy of exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $24.14021=\log_{2}18489594$
\end_inset

.
 Since there are a total of

\color none
18489594 observations of disjuncts in this dataset, the only way in which
 this entropy is possible is if every disjunct on these words was observed
 once and only once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking deeper into the disjunct set, the sensation that the words with
 the highest entropies are almost all verbs continues quite strikingly.
 A sampling is given in the table below.
 All of these words have a large support (i.e.
 have at least 100 observations of disjuncts on each), but each disjunct
 is observed only once, rarely twice; almost never more than that.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gripped
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has only one disjunct that was observed three times, seven that were observed
 twice, and 320 that were observed only once.
 A quick examination shows that many, maybe most, are grammatically reasonable,
 for example, for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gripped
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: (He- staff+) is the disjunct observed three times.
 Four of the seven observed twice are (had- him+) (she- his+ hand+) (He-
 staff+ tightly+) (his+ hand+) and look to be a part of rather formulaic
 sentences (possibly from the fan-fiction part of the corpus).
 The other three disjuncts observed twice are strange nonsense: (hands-
 Ross- at+ edge+ vanity+) (hand- jaw- other- top+) (LEFT-WALL- jockeyings-
 by+ them+).
 These seem to be the result of failed MST parses, depending, presumably,
 on word-pairs that were witnessed only a few times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This observation, and the table below, reinforces the need to the urgency
 of clustering words: by clustering words together into grammatical categories,
 this should increase the number of observations of category-pairs, improving
 MST parses, as well as increasing the number of observations of disjuncts,
 hopefully drowning out the weak and bizarre disjuncts.
 Given that the high-entropy words seem to be predominantly verbs, this
 suggests that clustering will be absolutely required to pick out the grammatica
l form of verbs.

The table employs a bit of notation worth reviewing.
 Recall the definition of the set that supports a word: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(w,*)=\left\{ (w,d)|N(w,d)>0\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

The notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(w,*)\right|$
\end_inset

 was used to indicate the size of this set.
 Extend this notation as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|(w,*)\right|_{k}=\mbox{sizeof }\left\{ (w,d)|N(w,d)\ge k\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(w,*)\right|_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the size of the support for when the disjuncts on word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 have been seen at least 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this table, it is now clear why 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

large entropy
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 can be intuitively understood to mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

many possibilities
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Each of these words was seen in a very broad setting of possibilities:
 in a sense, the broadest possible.
 Each of these words was observed with a vary large set of different disjuncts,
 and this set was as spread-out as possible: the vast majority of disjuncts
 were observed exactly once.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
More terms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some curious terms show up in relating the fractional mutual information
 to the fractional entropy.
 Expanding out the above summations, one obtains
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{word}(w)=H_{word}(w)+\log_{2}p(w,*)+\frac{1}{p(w)}\sum_{d}p(w,d)\log_{2}p(*,d)
\]

\end_inset

 The last term is bizarre...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Vertex degrees and hubiness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vertex degrees can be defined as the average number of connectors per disjunct.
 In principle, the vertex degree is an excellent indicator of the part of
 speech.
 For example, determiners, adjectives and adverbs typically have a degree
 of one: they have one connector, which is modifying the noun (or verb)
 that they act on.
 By contrast, nouns typically have a degree of two: one connector to attach
 to a verb, another to a modifier, and that's it.
 Verbs have a degree of three: one connector to a subject, one to a direct
 object, a third to an indirect object or a modifier.
 Of course, nouns might have two or more modifiers, or maybe zero modifiers;
 verbs are also quite variable, but the general concept of vertex degree
 is appealing.
 Closely related to this is the idea of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hubiness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which can be defined as the second moment of the degree.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, its worth looking at this.
 Define the average degree as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K(w)=\frac{\sum_{d,c}N(w,d)C(d,c)}{N(w,*)}
\]

\end_inset

This is graphed, below, for all words that have at least 100 observations.

This graph is unexpected.
 Having an average number of connectors that exceed 5 or 6 is intuitively
 surprising.
 In proper grammar, it would be hard to reach even this degree without having
 a transitive or ditranstive verb with several modifiers, and a particle
 or preposition.
 The first ten items are out of control.
 What's happening here? The first ten items in the ranking are: "|" "#"
 "+" "||" "_" "ASCII" "electronically" "Northup" "disclaimer" "u".
 The first five are presumably formating markup or possibly decorative markup
 in the texts.
 Three of the words appear to be license boilerplate.
 The name "Northup" appears in only one text in the corpus: an autobiography,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Twelve Years a Slave
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, by Solomon Northup.
 Besides the title-page, the word Northup appears repeatedly in the table
 of contents, which is bound to make for awkward parsing.
 This presumably 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

explains
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 why the average connector count would be 11.2 for this word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving further down this list, many of the words and symbols suggest that
 they appear in tables or lists embedded in the corpus.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

grammar
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of tables and lists is necessarily awkward, and seems unlikely to get much
 of a meaningful parse from the MST parser.

 suggesting that there were possibly 51 really bad parses of a very long
 table of Spanish kings, which was mistaken for being a single sentence.
 Clearly, its junk; its frequently-occurring junk, which suggests that the
 table was repeatedly transcluded in maybe 51 different Wikipedia pages.

The list continues in a similar way, for quite a while.
 The green line suggests that if some 30 or so pathological cases are ignored,
 the system settles down to a more respectable behavior.
 Entries 30 through 50 in the rankings are "Bay" "Street" "Island" "of"
 "century" "right" "Game" "Georgian" "or" "a" ";" "near" "Party" "team"
 "law" "Australia" "her" "research" "Church" "east" "Government".
 Notable is a preponderance of capitalized words, suggesting more tables
 of various sorts, and a complete lack of verbs.
 A spot-check of words like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

team
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

law
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shows that the pathological behavior continues.
 Several conclusions are possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One conclusion is that there is a severe shortage of verbs in Wikipedia
 articles, and this makes sense: its primarily descriptive, rather than
 active: running, jumping, hitting, putting, mixing, giving, setting are
 not the kinds of verbs that are required to describe a typical encyclopedia
 topic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another conclusion is that perhaps the number of observations of pairs are
 insufficient to get deep, reliable MST parsing.
 Junk links get used because there were not enough appropriate word-pairs
 seen to give a good-quality MST parse.
 A related conclusion is that the connector-set dataset is also too thin:
 The grammatically reasonable connectors are observed not even a few dozen
 times, barely pushing them out of the noise-floor of onesie-twosie observations
 of junk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So: bigger datasets, and an urgent need for non-Wikipedia content.
 Fiction, and presumably teen fiction should be filled with the kinds of
 active verbs describing human motions and actions, and should be absent
 of tables and lists masquerading as sentences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Hubiness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the above, hubiness can be defined as the second moment of the
 connector count:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
hub(w)=\frac{\sum_{d,c}N(w,d)C^{2}(d,c)}{N(w,*)}-K^{2}(w)
\]

\end_inset

Given the earlier Zipfian results on the average degree 
\begin_inset Formula $K(w)$
\end_inset

, it should be no surprise that a ranked listing of words by hubiness is
 very nearly identical to the listing for average degree.
 This is, after all, what the scale-free nature of the Zipfian distribution
 really means.
 Not only is the ranking nearly the same, but one also has the approximate
 equality 
\begin_inset Formula $hub(w)\approx2K(w)$
\end_inset

 to some ten or twenty percent.

\begin_layout Standard
The cosine similarity between two vectors is simply their inner product.
 In this case, given two words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}$
\end_inset

, it is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}N(w_{1},d)N(w_{2},d)}{\mbox{len}(w_{1})\mbox{len}(w_{2})}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{len}(w)$
\end_inset

 is the root-mean-square length (Euclidean length) of the connector-set
 vector:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{len}(w)=\sqrt{\sum_{d}N^{2}(w,d)}
\]

\end_inset

The current dataset being analyzed (the

The top-ten similarity pairs (for which

 Summary' 'Stats ..
 Rating' 'Category ..
 Rating' 'She ..
 He' 'Category ..
 Fandom' 'Stats ..
 Fandom' 'Category ..
 Character' 'Stats ..
 Character' 'she ..
 he'.
 The first one has a cosine of exactly 1.0, and the rest are above 0.975.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Stats
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Category
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 have exactly one disjunct: it is 'LEFT-WALL- :+' That is, these appear
 as the first word in a sentence, and are immediately followed by a colon.
 The word 'Notes' has 27 distinct disjuncts, but only three are observed
 more than 6 times: 'Chapter- or LEFT-WALL- or End-' That is, 'Notes' appears
 either all by itself, or as the phrase 'Chapter Notes' or as 'End Notes'.
 The word 'Summary' has 47 distinct disjuncts, but only two appear more
 than 6 times: 'Chapter- or LEFT-WALL-' i.e.
 either as a solitary word, or as the phrase 'Chapter Summary'.
 This is why 'Notes' and 'Summary' are considered to be so similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing in this fashion: 'Rating' has 7 disjuncts, four of which are
 observed more than 6 times: '(LEFT-WALL- :+) or (LEFT-WALL- :+ Audiences+)
 or (LEFT-WALL- :+ Explicit+) or (LEFT-WALL- :+ Mature+)' This suggests
 it appears in a table of some sort.
 The first disjunct '(LEFT-WALL- :+)' accounts for its high similarity to
 both 'Stats' and 'Category'.
 So, yes, all these words have been discovered to behave in a grammatically
 similar fashion; however, this behavior is somewhat boring: they arise
 from the regularity of some table listing.

\begin_layout Standard
The pair 're ..
 non' seems strange, but closer examination shows that both are usually
 followed by a hyphen, and that this accounts for all of the observed similarity
 between these two.
 The pair 'don ..
 sama' is also strange.
 The similarity is due entirely to their linking to dashes and other punctuation.
 It seems to be due to a Finnish text that has snuck into the corpus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some more verbs are worth looking at.
 Here is 'leave ..
 take', below.
 Almost all of the similarity is due the infinitive form; the only other
 shared disjunct appearing in the table is 'to- it+', although there are
 more common disjuncts at lower counts.

\begin_layout Standard
The first prepositions in the list are 'in ..
 by' and so are worth a look.
 Most of the similarity is accounted for by having them precede a determiner.
 Why there is a strong link to a determiner is unclear.
 Whether there is also a strong link between the determiner and a subsequent
 noun is also unclear.

\begin_layout Standard
The above table clearly indicates why the cosine similarity between these
 four words is high.
 Yet, it is also disappointing: the primary reason is that they all take
 the determiner 'the', and occur at the end of phrases (the- ,+) or at the
 end of sentences (the- .+).
 This seems superficial, at best.
 After that, there's not so much similarity, and what there is still falls
 back onto the presence of determiners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The similarity above is predicated on the frequent pairing of a word with
 a determiner.
 The pairing itself is correct, but perhaps not entirely significant: the
 word-pairs that needed to appear in the MST parse to extract these disjuncts
 had almost abysmally low MI values.
 They were clearly high enough to allow the MST parse to move forward, but
 are not otherwise terribly promising.
 They are shown below.

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that, for word-pairs, that MI scores below 4 are considered to be
 quite poor.
 That the scores above are poor is not surprising: determiners link with
 almost any noun, but not to verbs: this is enough to get them into the
 2-3 range for MI.
 By contrast, the period can appear after almost any word, except maybe
 for prepositions, adjectives and adverbs.
 This is apparently enough to drive the MI positive, but that's all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above suggests that using the raw observation count to compute the cosine
 similarity is perhaps not the best way to compute similarity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Score Cosine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above results suggest that perhaps the correct way to assign a score
 is to total up the word-pair MI scores for each disjunct, and use that
 to form a cosine.
 That is, define
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
sc(w,d)=\sum_{c\in d_{+}}mi(w,c)+\sum_{c\in d_{-}}mi(c,w)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{+}\subseteq d$
\end_inset

 is the subset of connectors that connect to the right, and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{-}\subseteq d$
\end_inset

 is the subset of connectors that connect to the left.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $c\in d$
\end_inset

 is simply one of the words that the connector is connecting to.
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $mi(w,c)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $mi(c,w)$
\end_inset

 are the word-pair MI scores.
 The cosine similarity might then be defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sos}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}sc(w_{1},d)sc(w_{2},d)}{\sqrt{\sum_{d}sc{}^{2}(w_{1},d)}\sqrt{\sum_{d}sc^{2}(w_{2},d)}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea here is that connectors to punctuation, and connectors to determiners,
 which might be observed quite often, but have a naturally low MI score,
 will contribute relatively little to the overall cosine similarity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is this a reasonable thing to do? Well, the previous two tables already
 suggested that the four words 'city' 'house' 'village' and 'world' should
 be placed into the same grammatical class, simply because of the high frequency
 with which they connect to a determiner.
 More subtle differences carrying a semantic signal might be getting washed
 out in this process.
 Perhaps the sos cosine score would be more sensitive to those processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But, if we are inventing scores, much more is possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Overlap Similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cosine similarity is perhaps too strict: it judges that two words are similar
 when they share not only the same collection of disjuncts, but have these
 occur with the same frequencies.
 Perhaps its enough to say that two words are grammatically similar, if
 they simply share the same set of disjuncts.
 This suggests ignoring the relative counts, or at least, sharply filtering
 them.
 Thus, the overlap similarity can be defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{ovl}(w_{1,}w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}\sigma(N(w_{1},d))\sigma(N(w_{2},d))}{\sum_{d}\sigma(N(w_{1},d)+N(w_{2},d))}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)$
\end_inset

 is some sigmoid function.
 In the most basic case, its a step function: 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)=1$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $x>C$
\end_inset

 for some constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and zero otherwise.
 Each term in the numerator sum is one only when both disjuncts are present.
 Each term in the denominator is one when either disjunct is present.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This similarity measure essentially boils down to a normalized cylinder-set
 measure.
 That is, instead of interpreting the disjuncts as a basis for a vector
 space, they can be taken as independent observations in a Cartesian product
 space.
 This makes more sense than pretending that these form a vector space.
 Why is that? What makes the cosine angle, and vector dot products so appealing,
 is that they are preserved by rotations; yet there really is no reason
 to expect or desire rotational symmetry.
 In short, the idea that we are dealing with vector spaces give the wrong
 idea of what's going on: its more appropriate to view the set of disjuncts
 as elements of a product space.
 Product spaces have a natural measure: the cylinder-set measure.
 The overlap similarity is essentially 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(A\cap B)/\mu(A\cup B)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 the Borel measure, and the intersection/union being taken over the associated
 disjunct sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing in this vein, what should be taken as the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(A)$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

? The counting measure is a natural choice; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(A)=\left|A\right|$
\end_inset

 being the number of elements in set 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Because we also have a count associated with the members of the set, we
 can consider using the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{p}$
\end_inset

 norms for the measure.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|A\right|$
\end_inset

 is just the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

 norm; perhaps 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(A)=\left\Vert A\right\Vert _{p}$
\end_inset

 could also work.
 For the purposes here, this may be enough; note, however, that only 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}$
\end_inset

 satisfy one of the axioms of measure theory: namely, that when 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cap B=\varnothing$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(A\cup B)=\mu(A)+\mu(B)$
\end_inset

.
 The other 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{p}$
\end_inset

 norms do not satisfy this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The (opencog matrix) module currently implements an overlap similarity which
 computes the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

-norm based similarity: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{ovl}_{0}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\left|\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }0<N\left(w_{1},d\right)\right\} \cap\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }0<N\left(w_{2},d\right)\right\} \right|}{\left|\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }0<N\left(w_{1},d\right)\right\} \cup\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }0<N\left(w_{2},d\right)\right\} \right|}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }0<N\left(w,d\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the set of disjuncts 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 such that the cset 
\begin_inset Formula $(w,d)$
\end_inset

 was observed at least once.
 As always, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\left\{ x\right\} \right|$
\end_inset

 is the number of elements in the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x\right\} $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some experimentation was done with this similarity measure, but the results
 were not particularly impressive.
 What does become quickly apparent is that the most frequently observed
 words will necessarily have a low similarity to the low-frequency words.
 This is because the high-frequency words will have a large number of disjuncts
 observed with them, thus causing the denominator to grow large.
 The numerator, by contrast, stays small, essentially limited by the number
 of disjuncts observed on the low-frequency word.
 This behavior is not what we want.
 Intuition suggests that we really do want to be able to compare words,
 independent of how frequently they occur.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This suggests a modified form of overlap similarity, by normalizing to a
 common count.
 That is, one should work with 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,d)/N(w,*)$
\end_inset

, which can be understood as the normalized probability of observing a disjunct
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 on some word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 So, arrange the words such that 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w_{1},*\right)>N\left(w_{2},*\right)$
\end_inset

 and define 
\begin_inset Formula $K\left(w_{1},d\right)=N\left(w_{1},d\right)N\left(w_{2},*\right)/N\left(w_{1},*\right)$
\end_inset

 -- this makes the counts on 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}$
\end_inset

 directly comparable to those on 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}$
\end_inset

, giving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{rovl}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\left|\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }1\le K\left(w_{1},d\right)\right\} \cap\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }1\le N\left(w_{2},d\right)\right\} \right|}{\left|\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }1\le K\left(w_{1},d\right)\right\} \cup\left\{ d\mbox{ s.t. }1\le N\left(w_{2},d\right)\right\} \right|}
\]

\end_inset

That is, the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le N\left(w_{2},d\right)$
\end_inset

 simply tests for the presence or absence of disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $K\left(w_{1},d\right)$
\end_inset

 gives the probability of observing disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}$
\end_inset

, if 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}$
\end_inset

 had been observed as often as 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above considerations suggest a more appropriate definition for overlap
 similarity that allows for frequency-independent observations: namely
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{ovl}(w_{1,}w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}\sigma(f(w_{1},d))\sigma(f(w_{2},d))}{\sum_{d}\sigma(f(w_{1},d)+f(w_{2},d))}
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $f(w,d)=N(w,d)/N(w,*)$
\end_inset

.
 In this form, the numerator now starts to resemble the numerator of the
 cosine similarity measure: both the cosine numerator, and this numerator
 are computing a kind-of overlap or intersection of sets of disjuncts.
 The denominators differ.
 Based on gut intuition, the above measure may be be more suitable for judging
 similarity than the cosine measure, precisely because it emphasizes the
 set-like qualities of connector sets, as opposed to vector-like qualities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Disjunct Subsets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above line of thinking suggests that another interesting comparison
 can be made by looking for a subset relationship between the disjuncts
 on different words.
 For example, transitive verbs should have all the connectors that intransitive
 verbs do, plus some more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overlay similarity can be adapted for this purpose: two sets obey a
 subset relation 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subset B$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cap(1-B)=\varnothing$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This re-affirms the previous observation: we expect connector-sets to behave
 in a set-like fashion, not a vector-like fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Connector Similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another, dual kind of similarity that is very different from the
 above proposals.
 A single disjunct is an ordered list of (pseudo-)connectors: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d=\left(c_{1},c_{2},\cdots,c_{k}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where each pseudo-connector is a word, and a direction indicator.
 We can judge two connectors to be similar, and thus, two words to be similar,
 if they appear in a large number of disjuncts that would be identical,
 but for that one connector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some practical difficulties of writing code to discern this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Word-Pair Cosine Similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To correctly gauge the advantage of disjunct-based techniques, one could
 compare them to the same kinds of measures, but applied to word-pairs,
 instead of word-disjunct pairs.
 For example, the disjunct-based cosine similarity, can be contrasted against
 the simpler word-pair-based cosine similarity.
 This is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sim}_{pair}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{w}N_{pair}(w_{1},w)N_{pair}(w,w_{2})}{\mbox{len}(w_{1})\mbox{len}(w_{2})}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{len}(w)$
\end_inset

 is the root-mean-square length (Euclidean length) of the pair vector:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{len}(w)=\sqrt{\sum_{v}N_{pair}(w,v)N_{pair}(v,w)}
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{pair}(w,v)$
\end_inset

 is the count of having observed the ordered word-pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(w,v)$
\end_inset

.
 Equivalently, writing the normalized frequency of observing a word pair
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,v)=N(w,v)/N(*,*)$
\end_inset

, this similarity can be written in the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sim}_{pair}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{w}p(w_{1},w)p(w,w_{2})}{\sqrt{\sum_{v}p(w_{1},v)p(v,w_{1})}\sqrt{\sum_{v}p(w_{2},v)p(v,w_{2})}}
\]

\end_inset

Note that this similarity measure is NOT symmetric: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})\ne\mbox{sim}(w_{2},w_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 This is because it's built out of a manifestly non-symmetric count: 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,v)\ne p(v,w)$
\end_inset

 and should really be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,v)=p(R;w,v)$
\end_inset

 with the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 encompassing all of the constraints of pair-wise word relationships (including,
 for example, that the pair might have been extracted from a random planar
 tree parse).
 Of course, one could construct a symmetrized similarity measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point here is that this measure treats words as similar with they link,
 pair-wise, to the same kinds of words, with the same kinds of frequencies.
 This is not unlike the similarity that the disjunct-cosine is measuring,
 except that the disjunct carries additional grammatical information with
 it: it captures more complex relationships between the words in a sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Cosine Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cosine similarity was defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}N(w_{1},d)N(w_{2},d)}{\sqrt{\sum_{d}N^{2}(w_{1},d)}\sqrt{\sum_{d}N^{2}(w_{2},d)}}
\]

\end_inset

which, after dividing by 
\begin_inset Formula $N(*,*)$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,d)=N(w,d)/N(*,*)$
\end_inset

, gives the equivalent expression 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}p(w_{1},d)p(w_{2},d)}{\sqrt{\sum_{d}p^{2}(w_{1},d)}\sqrt{\sum_{d}p^{2}(w_{2},d)}}
\]

\end_inset

Comparing this to the expression for mutual information suggests that using
 the vector support, instead of the vector length, could be interesting.
 In particular, these might be interesting:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{com}(w_{1},w_{2})=-\log_{2}\frac{\sum_{d}p(w_{1},d)p(w_{2},d)}{p(w_{1},*)p(w_{2},*)}
\]

\end_inset

Perhaps the following is closer to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

original intent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of mutual information: let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{dot}(w_{1},w_{2})=\sum_{d}p(w_{1},d)p(w_{2},d)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{dmi}(w_{1},w_{2})=-\log_{2}\frac{\mbox{dot}(w_{1},w_{2})\mbox{dot}(*,*)}{\mbox{dot}(w_{1},*)\mbox{dot}(*,w_{2})}
\]

\end_inset

Or even
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{cmi}(w_{1},w_{2})=-\log_{2}\frac{\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})\mbox{sim}(*,*)}{\mbox{sim}(w_{1},*)\mbox{sim}(*,w_{2})}
\]

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{sim}(*,*)$
\end_inset

 serves to normalize the entire calculation, so that one is effectively
 computing with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{norm-sim}(w_{1},w_{2})=\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})/\mbox{sim}(*,*)$
\end_inset

.
 Some experiments cmi were performed,, and it quickly became apparent that
 cmi does 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the wrong thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: it singles out pairs that have a lot to do with each other, but little
 to do with anything else.
 Which discriminates 
\emph on
against
\emph default
 the clusters of similar words, which is not what we want.
 We don't want strange, unusual pairings; we want common, likely pairings.
 The level of discrimination can be severe: some really, really bad pairings
 show up, but only because they are unlike anything else.
 This score is strong when sim is weak, and is essentially picking up the
 tail-end of the sim distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can be inspired to write some crazy concoctions:

\begin_layout Subsection*
Quality Cosine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The motivation for using cosine similarity is to find pairs of words that
 act in a grammatically similar fashion: they are used in the same way,
 with the same kinds of disjuncts.
 However, observational counts are subject to the vicissitudes of the input
 text: perhaps, instead of using vectors where the components are given
 by the frequency, once could instead use components based on, say, the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the disjunct itself.
 A disjunct could be judged as being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $mi(w,d)=MI_{pair}(w,d)$
\end_inset

 as defined in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "eq:mi-word-disjunct"

\end_inset

 is high.
 This motivates a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality cosine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{qim}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}mi(w_{1},d)mi(w_{2},d)}{\sqrt{\sum_{d}mi^{2}(w_{1},d)}\sqrt{\sum_{d}mi^{2}(w_{2},d)}}
\]

\end_inset

But what if the high quality is based on a pathetically small number of
 observations? Whenever one has a small number of observations, one has,
 almost automatically, a high MI value, simply because these two things
 are seen together, and nothing else is.
 Perhaps there should be some observational weighting.
 One can contemplate defining 
\begin_inset Formula $pi(w,d)=p(w,d)mi(w,d)$
\end_inset

 and so the cosine 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{pim}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}pi(w_{1},d)pi(w_{2},d)}{\sqrt{\sum_{d}pi^{2}(w_{1},d)}\sqrt{\sum_{d}pi^{2}(w_{2},d)}}
\]

\end_inset

 The suitability of these different means of judging similarity is not clear.

 That various forms of punctuation follow is not surprising.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this are various capitalized words.
 As noted previously, capitalized words are observed far less frequently
 than their u-capitalized counterparts -- usually only one capitalized word
 per sentence! Thus, capitalized words have far fewer disjuncts on them,
 thus making it easier for them to appear superficially similar, when they
 really should not be.

 'A' and 'Mai' are not similar, but then all of the given names are quite
 similar.
 Next, it turns out that 'George' and 'nothing' really don't have very much
 to do with one-another.
 And so the block-diagonal structure is exposed.

\begin_layout Standard
Reading through the list of 797 words in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "tab:Block-ranked-words"

\end_inset

 reveals a lot of interesting runs.
 All this suggests that cosine similarity really is doing the right thing.
 Equally reassuring are the failures of similarity: the end of the list
 of 797 words is populated with Gutenberg license boilerplate words.
 This is good: they are at the end of the list because they don't fit into
 any other grammatical usage patterns.
 They don't fit because they have been observed hundreds of times, which
 propels them into the high-frequency category; yet, since they always appear
 in set phrases, they can't be similar to anything else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Filtering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An earlier draft of this report showed a very different figure, which turned
 out to have been created based on what seemed to be a valid assumption,
 but turns out not to be so wise.
 It deserves a some discussion here, which is resumed in a later section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea (recaptured below) is that it can be a good thing to filter out
 noisy data.
 For example, one may choose to ignore words that have not been seen many
 times.
 This is the cut done up above: there are only 797 words observed with a
 length of 128 or greater.
 This is a convenient number only because it allows a 797-pixel-wide color
 plot to be made.
 A different cut might exclude words that were observed less than N times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another possibility, and this seems to be the fatal one, is to exclude disjuncts
 that are seen only a handful of times.
 Superficially, this seems like a very plausible thing to do.
 In practice, this turns out to be an almost completely disastrous cut.
 Setting it too high renders almost all capitalized words identical to one-anoth
er, having a similarity of exactly one.
 Capitalized words are observed only infrequently; discarding low-frequency
 disjuncts leaves the capitalized words almost naked, and thus essentially
 identical.
 Just about all of them connect to the LEFT-WALL, since they are the first
 word in a sentence, and so all of them share a very high observation count
 of links to LEFT-WALL, and low observation counts of links to anything
 else.
 Ergo: they are all similar, since they all start sentences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The damage doesn't stop there.
 It turns out that such trimming also raises similarity across the board:
 it ends up so that everything seems to be pretty darn similar to everything
 else, thus erasing too much of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

signal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that we are looking for.
 The original hope was to raise the signal-to-noise ratio by applying judicious
 cuts; but hope is not enough.
 Injudicious cuts can destroy the signal all too easily.
 Careful data analysis is needed; blind trust is not enough.

The legend is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Size The dimensions of the array.
 This is the number of unique, distinct words observed occurring on the
 left-side of a word pair, times the number of words occurring on the right.
 We expect the dimensions to be approximately equal, as most words will
 typically occur on both the left and right side of a pair.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Pairs The total number of distinct pairs observed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Obsn's The total number of observations of these pairs.
 Most pairs will be observed more than once.
 Distributions are typically Zipfian, as previous sections point out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Obs/pr The average number of times each pair was observed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Entropy The total entropy of these pairs in this dataset, as defined previously:
 for word-pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $(w_{L},w_{R})$
\end_inset

 it is 
\begin_inset Formula $H=-\sum_{w_{L},w_{R}}p(w_{L},w_{R})\log_{2}p(w_{L},w_{R})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
MI The total mutual information for the pairs in this dataset, as defined
 previously: 
\begin_inset Formula $MI=\sum_{w_{L},w_{R}}p(w_{L},w_{R})\log_{2}\left[p(w_{L},w_{R})/p(w_{L},*)p(*,w_{R})\right]$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The datasets are as below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_sim This contains text parsed from Wikipedia, only.
 As noted previously, Wikipedia is painfully short of verbs and pronouns.
 Compared to the Gutenberg datasets below, it is also very rich in foreign
 words and proper names (product and brand names, geographical place names,
 biographical mentions and other named entities).
 Issue: missing connectors the LEFT-WALL.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_tone_mst Text from Project Gutenberg 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tranche one
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, mostly all 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

famous authors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, popular, well-known 19th century books.
 Includes six modern sci-fi/fantasy novels from other sources, and some
 20th century non-fiction, including a military appraisal of Vietnam.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_ttwo_mst Tranche two - Everything from tranche one, plus fan-fiction
 from http://archiveofourown.org.
 Most of the selected texts were 10K words or longer.
 See the 'download.sh' file for the precise texts.
 Issues: tone_mst and ttwo_mst are missing connectors the LEFT-WALL.
 Certain types of punctuation is mis-handled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_tthree Tranche three - Everything in tranche two, plus several
 hundred of the most recently created Project Gutenberg texts, whatever
 they may be.
 See the 'download.sh' file for the precise texts.
 The _mst version has the same issues that ttwo_mst has, although some connector
s to LEFT-WALL do get added.
 The _mst version is probably not useful for similarity measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_rone_mst Same as en_pairs_tone_mst, but with minor issues fixed.
 However, links to LEFT-WALL still missing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_rtwo_mst As above, tranche 1 & 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_rthree As above, tranche 1,2 & 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
en_pairs_rfive As above, tranche 1,2,3,4 & 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
zh_pairs_sone A parse of Mandarin Wikipedia, with each individual character
 (hanzi) treated as a single item (so that, during pair-counting, pairs
 are formed between items).
 Non-Chinese characters are grouped into words in the normal way, by splitting
 according to white-space (and punctuation).
 Thus, the total dimensions of the dataset are given by the number of observed
 Chinese characters (hanzi) plus the number of observed non-Chinese words
 (and punctuation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
zen_pairs A parse of a small set of Mandarin novels, with text segmented
 into words by external third-party tools (provided by Ruiting).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, for some commentary, as to the summary stats.
 For English, as the number of pair observations increase, so do the number
 of unique, distinct words.
 The relation even seems to be linear: double the number of pair observations,
 and the number of different words also increases.
 This suggests something Zipfian at work.
 The explosion of words is hypothesized to be given names, although these
 datasets all fail to split hyphenated words, and so some may be due to
 that.
 The point is that the average observations per pair increases with difficulty,
 and the entropy and MI does not budge at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing the English _sim dataset to the _rone, _rtwo and _rthree datasets
 does provide some contrast: The _sim dataset, built from Wikipedia, is
 distinctly different from the Gutenberg datasets.
 Certainly, the prose style in the two datasets is quite different, with
 Wikipedia consisting of statements of facts (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

has
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 relational statements) concerning a broad range of named entities, whereas
 the Gutenberg texts are primarily narrative adventures (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

did
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

went
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 activity statements) involving fictional personages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing English to Chinese is very interesting.
 The Chinese dataset has three times, almost four times more observations
 per pair; equivalently about 3-4 fewer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is partly due to the fixed number of ideograms in the language.
 Remarkably, the entropy and MI are untouched.
 This suggests that the entropy and MI are capturing something about the
 human nature of language use, as opposed to something descriptive of the
 language itself.
 However, a lot more data would be needed to see if this is really true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's something else interesting going on, shown in the table below.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The columns are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Size The left and right dimensions, as before.
 Viz, the number of unique, distinctly different words observed on the left
 and the right side of a pair.
 Viewed as a matrix, this is the number of columns and rows in the matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Support The support is the average number of word-pairs that a word participates
 in (on the left, or on the right).
 Viewed as a matrix, this is the average number of non-zero entries in each
 row or column.
 Viewed as (row or column) vectors, this is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

support
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a (row or column) vector.
 Mathematically, this is the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

 norm of each vector: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(w_{L},*)\right|=\sum_{w_{R}}\left(0<N(w_{L},w_{R})\right)$
\end_inset

 and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(*,w_{R})\right|=\sum_{w_{L}}\left(0<N(w_{L},w_{R})\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Count The count is the average number of observations that a word-pair was
 observed, for a given word.
 Viewed as a matrix, this is the average value of each non-zero entry (averaged
 over rows, or columns).
 Viewed as vectors, this is the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}$
\end_inset

 norm divided by the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

 norm.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}$
\end_inset

 norm is just the wild-card counts 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w_{L},*)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N(*,w_{R})$
\end_inset

, where as always, the wild-card counts are defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w_{L},*)=\sum_{w_{R}}N(w_{L},w_{R})$
\end_inset

.
 The count shown in the table is then the average count: 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w_{L},*)/\left|(w_{L},*)\right|$
\end_inset

 for the rows, and likewise for the columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Length The length is the average length of the row and column vectors.
 This is the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{2}$
\end_inset

 norm divided by the 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

 norm.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{2}$
\end_inset

 norm is just the standard concept of the length of a vector in Euclidean
 space.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $L(w_{L},*)=\sqrt{\sum_{w_{R}}N^{2}(w_{L},w_{R})}$
\end_inset

, and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $L(*,w_{R})=\sqrt{\sum_{w_{L}}N^{2}(w_{L},w_{R})}$
\end_inset

.
 The length is interesting, because it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

penalizes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 word-pairs with only a small number of counts.
 The act of squaring the count has the effect of giving much higher 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

confidence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to large observation counts: a word-pair observed twice as often is given
 four times the credit.
 The length shown in this table is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 length: it is 
\begin_inset Formula $L(w_{L},*)/\left|(w_{L},*)\right|$
\end_inset

 for the rows, and likewise for the columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here's what is so interesting in this table: the support, for Chinese,
 is outrageously different than it is for English.
 For a given item (hanzi, for Chinese, word, for English), the Chinese hanzi
 participates in three to four fewer item-pairs! Since pairs are formed
 on a sentence-by-sentence basis, this means that the variety of different
 hanzi that can occur in a single sentence is much more constrained, much
 more strongly correlated.
 Now, perhaps this comparison is not quite valid: because we are not comparing
 words to words, but rather English words to Chinese 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

morphemes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (in the sense that Chinese words are typically composed of 1, 2 or 3 hanzi).
 Still, its interesting and surprising.
 This has knock-on effects: the observational counts are much higher, as
 are the average lengths.
 It would be interesting to repeat the previously given analysis of the
 various distributions, and see how they differ.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Disjunct datasets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, datasets that hold disjuncts.
 This section used to report more data, but it was all flawed: the MI had
 a minus sign in it, causing all computed disjuncts to be maximally bad.
 Despite this, the results were similar to the below: observations and entropy
 fit in line, as expected.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{left}$
\end_inset

 entropy values were lower, hovered around 15, and the MI was int the 3-5
 range, while 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{right}$
\end_inset

 was unchanged and fit in line.
 You can find the original data in the git commit 9244905afdff191a39af8c5a6deab5
92d5a1558c.

\begin_layout Description
Size The dimensions of the array.
 The left dimension counts words, the right dimension counts the number

Left-Right The left and right entropies, as defined previously.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $MI=H-H_{left}-H_{right}$

Thresholding PCA Classifier
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step is what I've called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clustering
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the past, but it really needs to be something more like factor analysis,
 or better yet, sparse PCA.
 Except that's not right, either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is needed is a recognizer,as follows.
 Consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{b}=\sum_{n}b_{n}w_{n}$
\end_inset

 be a vector, with the 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{n}$
\end_inset

T being individual words, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset

 being weights.
 Plain-old Principal Component Analysis (PCA) computes real-valued weights
 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 It's problematic, because potentially all of the weights are non-zero for
 all of the words.
 Sparse PCA computes real-valued weights 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset

 such that only some small number of them are non-zero.
 This is much better.
 But what is really needed is a classifier: a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset

 that are either zero or one, indicating the membership of a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{n}$
\end_inset

 in some class of words.
 (Note, by the way, that a word might belong to multiple classes, for example,
 according to its part-of-speech, or it's meaning.) This suggests a neural-netish
 variant on iterative PCA, described below.
 But, before giving this, some general remarks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Preliminary comments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definition of PCA requires a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 that connects columns and rows in some way.
 In the conventional definition, it is a matrix connecting variables and
 measurements.
 The variables (the features being measured) are organized in the columns;
 the measurements in rows.
 The PCA algorithm effectively computes the eigenvectors of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{T}X$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{T}$
\end_inset

 denoting the transpose of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{T}X$
\end_inset

 is proportional to the covariance matrix between the different features
 being observed.
 The principal component is the the direction of the greatest variation
 in this matrix.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What plays the role of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 in the current situation, and how should the principal component be understood
 and interpreted? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we have on hand, foundationally, is the frequency matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 with components 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,d)$
\end_inset

 connecting words with disjuncts.
 It was defined previously as 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,d)=N(w,d)/N(*,*)$
\end_inset

, and where 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,d)$
\end_inset

 is the number of times word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 has been observed with disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 As noted earlier, 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,d)$
\end_inset

 is very large and very sparse: typically 
\begin_inset Formula $200K\times4M$
\end_inset

 in recent datasets, with only 1 entry out of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{15}$
\end_inset

 being non-zero.

I plan to send out the revised, expanded statistical analysis 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The extreme sparsity indicates that a power-iteration algorithm will be
 the most efficient for implementing a PCA algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we will examine will be the results on several different kinds of matrices
 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 derived from (constructed from) the base data matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

.
 In all cases, the features are words, and so in all cases, it is appropriate
 to write 
\begin_inset Formula $X=M^{T}$
\end_inset

; that is, we work mostly with the transpose of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 as usually given in standard texts.
 This follows from the standard Link Grammar dictionary: the word is followed
 by the disjuncts it can employ.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
PCA of the frequency matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should we identify 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{T}$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{T}X=PP^{T}$
\end_inset

? We can, but then we don't get what we want.
 Computing the principal component of this matrix for a recent dataset (see
 later section below), we get the following vector shown below.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

weight
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 gives the magnitude of the vector component.
 The other two columns are the support for the word, and the number of observati
ons, and are shown for comparison.

\begin_layout Standard
What does this mean? What can we do with this? Why is the weight of the
 period so high? In essence, this vector is stating that the greatest variety
 of disjuncts are associated with the period.
 Since periods are sentence enders, and every sentence has one, a link to
 the end of the sentence will attach to just about any word.
 That is, the period almost single-handedly accounts for almost all of the
 variance of the disjuncts in the dataset.
 The rest of the list is filled out with words that also attach freely and
 easily to just about anything: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should attach only to nouns, but common nouns wildly outnumber all of the
 other parts of speech put together.
 Similar remarks for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

to
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The comma can connect in a large variety of situations, and the closing
 quotation mark ” behaves much like a sentence-ender (This particular dataset
 contains a lot of dialog).
 The two columns labeled as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(w,*)\right|$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,*)$
\end_inset

 confirms this interpretation: so, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(w,*)\right|$
\end_inset

 is the total number of unique, different disjuncts that were observed with
 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w,*)$
\end_inset

 is the summation over all of the counts with which these disjuncts were
 seen.

If these numbers seem small, it is because they were taken from a sharply
 filtered dataset, the en_pairs_ttwo_mst dataset with the (50,30,10) cut
 applied.
 This cut is discussed later, below.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The top words, in terms of the variety and number of disjuncts, are more
 or less the makeup of the principal component of 
\begin_inset Formula $PP^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 This should not be a surprise.
 Anyway, this is not what we wanted: we want to classify sets of similar
 words; discovering which words account for the greatest variation in disjuncts
 is of secondary interest.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
PCA of the cosine similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We had previously defined the cosine similarity of two words as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})=\frac{\sum_{d}p(w_{1},d)p(w_{2},d)}{\sqrt{\sum_{d}p^{2}(w_{1},d)}\sqrt{\sum_{d}p^{2}(w_{2},d)}}
\]

\end_inset

and so, perhaps we should use this as the basis for judging the similarity
 of words.
 This suggests defining a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 with matrix components 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S(w,d)=\frac{p(w,d)}{\sqrt{\sum_{d}p^{2}(w,d)}}
\]

\end_inset

and then setting setting 
\begin_inset Formula $X=S^{T}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{T}X=SS^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 The idea here is that PCA allows a whole-set analysis of similarity, rather
 than point-wise similarity.
 That is, for normal clustering algorithms, one computes a large number
 of values for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{sim}(w_{1},w_{2})$
\end_inset

 and then employs a clustering algorithm to categorize these, word by word.
 Here, instead, perhaps PCA can reveal entire clusters in one gulp, by simultane
ously evaluating the similarity between all words in a cluster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Power iteration converges at about half of the rate as for the frequency
 matrix, which is not a surprise, as the off-diagonal entries are closer
 to one-another.
 The PCA vector, however, is not all that different: 0.978

 and so on, the remaining entries filled out in roughly the same order,

So why aren't some of these in the PCA vector?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
IMPORTANT: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some readers have misunderstood this section.
 We are NOT doing PCA to obtain similarity! We are examining it as an algo
 for CLUSTERING! That is, instead of doing k-means clustering, or agglomerative
 clustering, or something like that, the idea is/was to use a thresholded
 PCA for CLUSTERING! and NOT for similarity, because we've already got reasonabl
e adequate similarity.
 Higher-quality similarity might be nice, but that is of secondary importance,
 right now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
A bit of sheaf theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I recently realized that much of what is being discussed here can be anchored
 in the vocabulary of a generic mathematical theory, namely, sheaf theory.
 Sheaves allow topological structure to be discussed in a local way: sheaves
 describe how the local neighborhoods of a point glue together, to form
 a manifold as a whole.
 Link Grammar disjuncts and connector sets are really just the stalks and
 germs of sheaf theory, in mild disguise.
 This can be seen as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A standard way of expressing a graph is to list all of the vertexes in the
 graph, and to list all of the edges.
 Knowing these, one knows the graph.
 However, this is a global description: One does not know the local structure
 until one looks at specific vertexes, and what they attach to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A different way of describing a graph is to make a list of pairs: a vertex
 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 and all the edges that attach to it.
 More generally, one can consider pairs where a vertex 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is attached to a vertex 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 by means of a path of length 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 or less.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\mbox{vertex }v,\left\{ w\mbox{ s.t. vertex }w\mbox{ is attached to }v\right\} \right)
\]

\end_inset

This describes the graph, as a whole, just as well as the simpler vertex+edge
 list does.
 However, the language is different: these pairs are presheaves, obeying
 all the axioms of a presheaf, e.g.
 the composition of restriction morphisms.
 They become a sheaf because they also obey the gluing or collation axiom
 as well: they can be glued together to form the original graph from which
 they were taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, we can see that the set
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\mbox{vertex }v,\left\{ \mbox{ edges attached to }v\right\} \right)
\]

\end_inset

is the same thing as a Link Grammar dictionary entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be more precise, we need to distinguish the graph-sheaf that arises for
 a single sentence (from the dependency parse of the sentence) from the
 sheaf that arises from the entire language.
 If we take the language to consist of the set of all possible sentences,
 then the sheafification is to parse each of the sentences in the language,
 to get a dependency graph for each sentence, create the individual (word,
 connector-set) lists, and then take the quotient, identifying together
 all words that have the same spelling.
 This gives the sheaf of the entire language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From what I can tell, this realization that language can be sheafified is
 not new; when the language is not a natural language, but is instead first-orde
r logic, then it's sheafification gives the Kripke–Joyal semantics.
 According to Wikipedia, this was noted in 1965 for existential quantification.
 I don't know if this was ever noted for natural language before, but, as
 I've blathered on the mailing list before, this provides the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

answer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to why the logic of Link Grammar appears to be modal logic: Link Grammar
 dictionary entries are sheaves, and the disjuncts are the different 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

possible worlds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that a given word can inhabit.
 For a natural-language sentence, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there exists
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (existential quantification) a collection of disjuncts that can parse the
 sentence.
 Bingo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I used to say that LG disjuncts had something to do with linear logic, because
 linear logic also has the general whiff of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

possible worlds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 around it.
 I now see that in fact its actually modal logic, and it is the language
 of sheaves that provides the direct route from Link Grammar, to modal logic.
 It would be very interesting to see all the details worked out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most interesting is perhaps this: the sentences of a language are observed
 with some a priori frequency or probability.
 What's the correct way of converting this to a probability distribution
 on the sheaf? Next, given a probability distribution on the sheaf, what
 is the corresponding probability distribution on the corresponding modal
 logic? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems to me that one could make this very generic: every language, and
 not just first-order logic, but any language, as considered in model theory,
 has a set of sentences.
 This sentences are composed of the terms in their term algebra, and these
 terms and how they connect, define a graph.
 That graph can be viewed in terms of sheaves, germs, stalks, etale spaces.
 This implies that every model, of model theory, has a corresponding cohomology.
 Writing this out could be interesting.
 Perhaps this has already been done; perhaps this is what topos theory is.
 But I suspect that it's not been sufficiently popularized: certainly, the
 standard computer-science textbooks that tell you what a language is do
 not tell you that it has a cohomology associated with it.
 And yet, this seems blatantly obvious, in retrospect, and naggingly it
 might actually be important for some reason or another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway: this is not just all-talk, no-action.
 I've written some code that implements some sheaf-based parsing on the
 atomspace.
 It is in the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conclusions from the above:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pair-wise similarity is very promising.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The cosine similarity measure penalizes better, more accurate measurements,
 because better measurements are more likely to find dissimilarity.
 We need a better measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
PCA and sparse PCA, in the naive sense, applied to frequencies, or to cosine
 similarities, are inappropriate for classification.
 Its still possible that perhaps PCA applied to some sigmoid of the cosine
 similarity (e.g.
 cosine to the fourth power) might work better, but the selection of this
 sigmoid seems ad-hoc, and not anchored in any principles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
First principles suggest something Bayesian, based on the Gibbs measure,
 maybe some sort of hidden multi-variate logistic regression.
 Hidden, because we don't know the grammatical categories in any a priori
 sense; we must deduce them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It would be great if someone worked out the precise details in going from
 sheaves to modal logic.
 This was already done, in 1965, for topos theory; no one has done this
 for natural language, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Other similarity measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its worth noting that one of the other similarity measures, such as qim
 and pim, discussed previously, can also be treated in this way.
 Note also that a matrix can be constructed so that 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{T}X$
\end_inset

 becomes explicitly Markovian.
 This is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A(w,d)=\frac{p(w,d)}{p(*,d)}\quad\mbox{ and }\quad B(d,w)=\frac{p(w,d)}{p(w,*)}
\]

\end_inset

and then setting 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{T}X=AB$
\end_inset

.
 This has the property that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{w_{1}}\left[AB\right](w_{1},w_{2})=1
\]

\end_inset

That is, the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

 is a Markov matrix.
 It is straight-forward to compute using the standard power-iteration algorithm
 employed throughout this section.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

Pre-condition, filter the data.
 See step 10, below, for what to filter, and why.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Start with 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}=1/\sqrt{\left|w\right|}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|w\right|$
\end_inset

 is the number of unique words.
 This starting point is a unit-length vector, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\overrightarrow{b}\right|=1$
\end_inset

.
 Its convenient to change notation, here, and write 
\begin_inset Formula $b(w)$
\end_inset

 for the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{b}$
\end_inset

 at word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $b(w_{n})=b_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the same thing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 be the matrix for which the PCA is to be computed, with matrix components
 
\begin_inset Formula $M(w,d)$
\end_inset

 for word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 and disjunct 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 This matrix is derived from (defined in terms of) the frequency matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,d)$
\end_inset

 describing the base dataset.
 Compute the double-sum 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s(v)=\left[MM^{T}b\right](v)=\sum_{d}M(v,d)\sum_{w}M(w,d)b(w)
\]

\end_inset

which is basically a pair of dot products.
 Its still a large, time-consuming computation, even for sparse vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Normalize: set 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{b}\leftarrow\overrightarrow{s}/\left|\overrightarrow{s}\right|$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{b}$
\end_inset

 is of unit length.
 In theory, this is not needed; in practice, each iteration can sharply
 shrink the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{b}$
\end_inset

, making it very small, eventually leading to exponent underflow.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Repeat these steps 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 times: go to step 2 and run the summation again.
 The repetition here is the 'power iteration' or the 'von Mises iteration'
 method for computing the largest eigenvalue of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[MM^{T}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 It is not guaranteed to converge, and if it does, it might not do so quickly.
 But we deal with this in the next step, so its sufficient to keep 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 small, just enough to get a trend going.
 Another way to think of this is as a Markov process (specifically, a Markov
 chain).
 That is, the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[MM^{T}\right]$
\end_inset

 will behave essentially as a Markov chain, and iteration on it just identifies
 the primary Peron-Frobenius stable state (step 3 makes it Markovian, by
 preserving to total probability measure).
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[MM^{T}\right]$
\end_inset

 defines a weighted adjacency matrix for a graph, and iteration creates
 a measure-preserving process (walk) on this graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After the above repetitions, apply some standard neural-net sigmoid function
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{b}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, set 
\begin_inset Formula $b(w)\leftarrow\sigma(b(w))$
\end_inset

 for some sigmoid.
 This has the effect of driving some of the elements to zero, and others
 to one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Repeat this 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 times: go to step 2, and repeat steps 2-5.
 Viewing this as a dynamical system, the effect of the sigmoid function
 is to force the system into a block-diagonal form, with the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{b}$
\end_inset

 identifying a highly-connected block.
 Another way to look at this is as a graph factorization algorithm: the
 vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{b}$
\end_inset

 is identifying a well-connected subgraph, which is only weakly connected
 to the rest of the graph.
 The vector (viewed as a measure-preserving dynamical system) is spending
 most of its time in one particular block.
 Again, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[MM^{T}\right]^{k}$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-th power iterated matrix from step 4, can be thought of as a surrogate
 for a weighted graph adjacency matrix.
 A third way of thinking of this is as an 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-layer neural net, with the link weights between one layer and the next
 being given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[MM^{T}\right]^{k}$
\end_inset

.
 All three ways of looking at this are essentially equivalent: a measure-preserv
ing dynamical system, a chaotic and mixing process on a graph, or as an
 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-layer neural net.
 Pick your favorite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Classify.
 Pass the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{b}$
\end_inset

 through the step function, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $b(w)\leftarrow\Theta(b(w))$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta(x)=0$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $x<1/2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta(x)=1$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $x>1/2$
\end_inset

.
 The step function is a super-sharp sigmoid.
 This step identifies and isolates an active, well-connected subgraph of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[MM^{T}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 It identifies a square block, of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b\right|\times\left|b\right|$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b\right|$
\end_inset

 is the total number of non-zero entries in this final 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{b}$
\end_inset

.
 To belabor the point: the block-matrix is explicitly 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B(v,w)=b(v)b(w)\sum_{d}M(v,d)M(w,d)
\]

\end_inset

The non-zero elements of this final 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{b}$
\end_inset

 identify a class of words that can be considered to be grammatically similar
 or identical.
 This is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clustering
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Associated with this class of words is a disjunct set, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average disjunct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the class.
 It can be taken to be the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ d|0<\sum_{w}b(w)N(w,d)\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The observed counts associated with this set can be taken to be 
\begin_inset Formula $N(b,d)=\sum_{w}b(w)N(w,d)$
\end_inset

 and the frequencies similarly: 
\begin_inset Formula $p(b,d)=\sum_{w}b(w)p(w,d)$
\end_inset

.
 From here-on, the set of words 
\begin_inset Formula $b\equiv\{w|0\ne b(w)\}$
\end_inset

 can be treated as if it was an ordinary word, behaving like any other,
 with the indicated disjuncts, counts and frequencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since words can have have multiple meanings, or rather, multiple different
 kinds of grammatical behaviors based on their part of speech, the identified
 words need to be subtracted, en block, from the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,d)$
\end_inset

, and then the process repeated, to identify another class of words.
 Put another way, if 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is to be added to the set of words, as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just another word
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, then the frequencies 
\begin_inset Formula $p(b,d)$
\end_inset

 have to be subtracted from the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, and shunted to this new 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, so as not to loose the overall normalization.
 That is, one must preserve the identity 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{w,d}p(w,d)=1$
\end_inset

.
 So define, in the next iteration 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(w,d)\leftarrow\begin{cases}
p(b,d) & \mbox{ if }w=b\\
p(w,d)-b(w)p(b,d) & \mbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

(Hmmm.
 This may not be right, its late and I'm tired).
 This still sums to the identity except that now some of the values might
 go negative, and we don't want that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And so we get to what should be called step zero: We want to truncate, and
 discard the negative entries.
 This should have been carried out as an actual step 0: a pre-conditioning
 of the matrix: some noise filtering, e.g.
 discarding all words that were observed less than a handful of times, discardin
g rare or preposterous disjuncts.
 Pre-conditioning in this way will have the effect of removing some (possibly
 many) of the words from the matrix: the size of the matrix shrinks.
 This is the step where the actual dimensional reduction takes place: the
 size of the set of words is shrinking, as they get classified into sets.

Go to step 0 and repeat, until the preconditioning and noise-removal has
 left behind an empty matrix (or alternately, a matrix where all words have
 been classified into some group).
 So, for example, words which have only one part-of-speech or meaning would
 (hopefully should) get classified after just one step; words that are more
 complex, and have two parts of speech, would require at least two iterations.
 This is perhaps optimistic; I expect dozens of iterations to get anything
 vaguely accurate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There's one more step.
 After the formation of the class 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, we arrive at a situation where no (pseudo-)connectors connect to 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 directly.
 Instead, all disjuncts connect to words inside of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 But this is a problem: we don't know if any given connector actually connects
 to some 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in b$
\end_inset

 or if it connects to the same 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, but outside of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 (e.g.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 are nouns, then does 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

saw+
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 connect to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

saw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the noun, or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

saw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the verb?) Thus, after some small number of iterations of step 11, there
 needs to be a re-parse of the entire text, using these newly discovered
 classes of words.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's it.
 I think this should work fairly well.
 Clearly, there are many nested loops, and so this is potentially a very
 time-consuming computation.
 The number of iterations 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 need to be kept small, and the classification in step 11 needs to be kept
 greedy, because step 12 is expensive.
 An alternate strategy is to brutally precondition 
\begin_inset Formula $p(w,d)$
\end_inset

 to make it as small as possible; but this risks throwing out the baby with
 the bathwater: early on, we want to cluster together the rare, obscure,
 unused words as best as possible into large bins, and then devote large
 CPU resources to correctly classifying the remaining much smaller set of
 verbs and prepositions, which we know, 
\emph on
a priori,
\emph default
 to be complex and difficult, due to their grammatical variability.

The previous dataset

 Thus, data analysis here resumes with a different, considerably larger
 dataset, collected on a higher-quality corpus.
 This will be the

 To recap, it is this one:

\begin_layout Subsection*
Filtering, Step 0
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The filtering performed in step 0 (described in step 10, above) removes
 some of the noise in the dataset.
 Basic filtering is implemented in the 
\noun on
(opencog analysis)
\noun default
 scheme module, and specifically in the 
\noun on
filter.scm
\noun default
 file.
 One can remove rows and columns that have subtotal counts less than a cutoff,
 and also remove individual entries that have fewer than some number of
 counts.
 By removing very infrequently observed connector sets, some of drivers
 of accidental similarity or dis-similarity between words should be ameliorated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How much data does filtering actually discard? This dataset has 175559 rows.
 Each row corresponds to one unique, distinct word (columns correspond to
 disjuncts).
 Of these words, only 84984 were observed twice, or more: slightly less
 than half! Only 64882 words were seen three times or more; only 10% of
 the words were seen 32 times or more.
 The distribution is shown in the graph below.

The fraction of rows with more than 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 observations drops a little faster than 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{N}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that this graph is not scale-free; for larger datasets, the graph
 should progressively flatten.
 Since cumulative distributions are integrals of distributions, this is
 essentially the integral of some of the graphs shown before.
 A table of plausible cutoffs to use with this dataset is given below.
 There are three cuts one can make: discard words that are observed 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 or fewer times; discard disjuncts that were observed 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 or fewer times, and discard connector-sets (word-disjunct pairs) that were
 observed 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 or fewer times.
 These three cuts are given in the first three columns; the resulting dataset
 is given in the remaining columns.

The last cut seems plausible for further work: it suggests that each disjunct
 is observed a fairly strong number of times; and that given the word/disjunct
 ratio, a lot of words are using disjuncts in similar fashion; thus, there
 should be a lot of similarity.

Step 1-4 are implemented in the

 The implementation uses lazy evaluation to avoid unneeded computation,
 and caching of evaluation results to avoid repeated evaluations.

Iteration appears to converge very rapidly.
 After three iterations, the ranking, by weight in the vector, appears to
 be established.
 This is shown in the figures below.
 Six iterations are performed, and the words

 are then ranked according to the strength 
\begin_inset Formula $b(w)$
\end_inset

 in the sixth iteration.
 Then the values of

\end_inset

 are plotted for the first five iterations, using this rank.
 After the third iteration, there is no discernible change in the weights.

 relations are symmetric: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 It is at least plausible that such relations could be data-mined, with
 no

 knowledge of the words.
 Anyway, this provides the setting for the initial grammatical tasks.
 So, back to the initial grammatical tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Idioms: based on preliminary evidence, we could make lists of idiomatic
 phrases, now, based only on high-MI word-disjunct relations.
 But these are useless, until we can build a list of synonymous words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discerning synonymous words based on grammatical usage is tricky.
 First, it is often antonyms that get observed: e.g.
 the (black,white) pairs reported above.
 To discern antonymy, we would also need to discern is-a relationships,
 apply common-sense reasoning, and notice that antonyms never describe the
 same objects, never describe the properties of the same objects.
 So, antonym detection appears to be an advanced topic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Clustering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We could go full-speed ahead on trying to discern grammatical categories,
 but for several issues: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Merging two items into one necessarily entails a loss of information.
 That is, one necessarily has that 
\begin_inset Formula $-(p_{a}+p_{b})\log_{2}(p_{a}+p_{b})\le-p_{a}\log_{2}p_{a}-p_{b}\log_{2}p_{b}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, information is necessarily lost.
 How can we minimize information loss? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If a classification error is made early on, can it be spotted, and later
 corrected? What is the mechanism, and how might it work?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

information loss
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to our advantage if the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lost information
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is in fact just noise in the data.
 That is, the data is necessarily noisy, and the naive calculation of the
 entropy and mutual information encodes both that noise and the signal we
 are searching for.
 Clustering together items, and the associated information loss, is desirable
 if the loss results in the filtering out of noise.
 How can we characterize the noise in the observations?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If an event is normally distributed, then we can characterize the uncertainty
 as being 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\sqrt{N}$
\end_inset

 after 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 observations.
 We don't actually know if our observations are normally distributed.
 Its not even clear quite how to even obtain the distribution.
 But lets assume they are.
 Then, given that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x,y)=N(x,y)/N(*,*)$
\end_inset

 and estimating the noise to go as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{N(x,y)}$
\end_inset

 we get that the error in the frequentist probability estimate is given
 by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{N(x,y)\pm\sqrt{N(x,y)}}{N(*,*)}=p(x,y)\pm\sqrt{\frac{p(x,y)}{N(*,*)}}
\]

\end_inset

where only the pair observations 
\begin_inset Formula $N(x,y)$
\end_inset

 are considered to be noisy and the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $N(*,*)$
\end_inset

 is held fixed (the natural variation in it is ignored).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The error in the frequentist estimate of the entropy to be
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\log_{2}\left[p(x,y)\pm\sqrt{\frac{p(x,y)}{N(*,*)}}\right]=-\left[\log_{2}p(x,y)\right]\pm\frac{1}{\log2}\sqrt{\frac{1}{p(x,y)N(*,*)}}
\]

\end_inset

where the estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\log(1+\epsilon)\approx\epsilon$
\end_inset

 is used for small 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 Summing to estimate the total entropy, one gets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H\pm\Delta H=-\sum_{x,y}\left[p(x,y)\pm\sqrt{\frac{p(x,y)}{N(*,*)}}\right]\log_{2}\left[p(x,y)\pm\sqrt{\frac{p(x,y)}{N(*,*)}}\right]
\]

\end_inset

which expands out to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta H=\frac{-1}{\sqrt{N(*,*)}}\sum_{x,y}\sqrt{p(x,y)}\left(\frac{1}{\log2}+\log_{2}p(x,y)\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What might these values be, in practice? As a worked example, consider the
 word-pair (big, deal) in the 
\noun on
en_pairs_rthree
\noun default
 dataset.
 It is observed 1039 times, out of 638845863 pair observations (639M) total.
 Plugging and chugging, one gets 
\begin_inset Formula $H=-\log_{2}p(\mbox{big},\mbox{deal})=19.23$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta H=0.552$
\end_inset

 which seems to be eminently reasonable.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta H$
\end_inset

 depends only on 
\begin_inset Formula $N(x,y)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N(*,*)$
\end_inset

 and is graphed below, for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $N(*,*)=639M$
\end_inset

.
 It does not take very many observations to drive the uncertainty to a fairly
 small value.

\begin_layout Standard
Also, when clustering, should we create a single common category

bw

Chinese character pair dataset July 2017

\begin_layout Standard
This report provides a quick sketch of a dataset containing Mandarin Chinese
 character pairs.
 This differs from English in two important ways.
 First, obviously, its not English.
 Second, there was no word segmentation done: each character (hanzi, ideogram)
 is treated as being distinct, and so all pairs are between hanzi.
 The goal/hope here is that word segmentation will appear 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

As mentioned before: the dimensions of the dataset are larger than the number
 of hanzi, because the dataset treats all Latin-alphabet words as single
 words.
 Since this dataset is generated from Wikipedia, we can expect that many
 of the entries correspond to English-language technical terms and named
 entities, such as product names, geographical place names and the names
 of people.
 There is also likely to be a mixture of simplified and traditional hanzi
 in the dataset.

Sheaf structures are important
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposal being advanced here is that the general sheaf-theoretic techniques
 can be used to discover all of these structures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest case would seem to be word-boundary detection in Chinese.
 Here, a word boundary might be one, two or three hanzi characters in a
 row.
 It seems that basic MST techniques should be enough to discover these.
 So, for example, given a hanzi sequence A B C D E, if the MST parse provides
 a link B-C and C-D but no link A-B and no link D-E, then the sequence BCD
 is a candidate for being identified as a word.
 However, observing this once is not statistics: only if the sequence BCD
 is observed many times, can one consider it to be a word.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More complex structures can be found using sheaf-theoretic techniques.
 The example below is taken from the existing Link-Grammar lexis to illustrate
 a search for circumpositions.
 Consider the sentence

The above structure might occur in many other sentences, and not just in
 this sentence.
 One can keep an eye out for this structure.
 If it occurs more often than usual, one can deduce that it is some set
 phrase or idiom.
 This particular example is not a set phrase in English, but it does illustrate
 how one can describe structure, and search for it, in a way that is more
 sophisticated than using n-grams.

Word boundaries - Chinese

So ...
 how does one find word-boundaries in Chinese? The basic idea is to count
 the frequency of patterns such as the below, where BCD are sequentially
 linked, and there are no links AB or DE.
 There may be additional links from the triple BCD going elsewhere, but
 not to neighboring words.
 Ideally, those links attach to just one morpheme.

If this was a European language, we would expect any extra links to attach
 to the last morpheme; this is due to the morphology of Indo-European, where
 the semantic (meaning-carrying) stem is always to the left of the grammatically
 active suffixes.
 Note Japanese, although it has a minimal morphology, as also similarly
 structured; i.e.
 the suffix carries the syntactic structure.
 With Chinese, this is less obviously the case, and ideally, the correct
 attachment will be discovered.
