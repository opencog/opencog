	abstract = {Intelligent agents must be able to handle the complexity and uncertainty of the real world. Logical AI has focused mainly on the former, and statistical AI on the latter. Markov logic combines the two by attaching weights to first-order formulas and viewing them as templates for features of Markov networks. Inference algorithms for Markov logic draw on ideas from satisfiability, Markov chain Monte Carlo and knowledge-based model construction. Learning algorithms are based on the voted perceptron, pseudo-likelihood and inductive logic programming. Markov logic has been successfully applied to problems in entity resolution, link prediction, information extraction and others, and is the basis of the open-source Alchemy system.},

	abstract={Here we study the arrangement of vertices of trees in a
		1-dimensional Euclidean space when the Euclidean distance between linked
		vertices is minimized. We conclude that links are unlikely to cross when
		drawn over the vertex sequence. This finding suggests that the
		uncommonness of crossings in the trees specifying the syntactic
		structure of sentences could be a side-effect of minimizing the
		Euclidean distance between syntactically related words. As far as we
		know, nobody has provided a successful explanation of such a
		surprisingly universal feature of languages that was discovered in the
		60s of the past century by Hays and Lecerf. On the one hand, support for
		the role of distance minimization in avoiding edge crossings comes from
		statistical studies showing that the Euclidean distance between
		syntactically linked words of real sentences is minimized or constrained
		to a small value. On the other hand, that distance is considered a
		measure of the cost of syntactic relationships in various frameworks. By
		cost, we mean the amount of computational resources needed by the brain.
		The absence of crossings in syntactic trees may be universal just
		because all human brains have limited resources.}
