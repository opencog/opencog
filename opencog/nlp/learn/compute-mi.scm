; OVERVIEW
; --------
; The scripts below are concerned with counting "things" and pairs of
; "things", and computing the mutual information of pairs. In the
; desription that follows, it will be assumed that the "things" are
; words, just to keep things simple.  However, the scripts are general,
; and are not limited to just words.
;
; It is presumed that a database of counts of word-pairs has been already
; generated; these scripts work off of those counts. Typically, the word
; pairs are obtained from parsing some language.  We say "database" here,
; instead of "atomspace", because the scripts will automatically fetch the
; needed data from the (SQL) persistence backend, as  needed.  This
; allows long-running and parallel-parsing efforts.
;
; It is assumed that all word-pair observations are stored as the
; "count" portion of the CountTruthValue on the EvaluationLink below:
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "Blah"
;      ListLink
;         WordNode "some-word"
;         WordNode "other-word"
;
; The type 'WordNode is configurable; see item-type, below. The name of
; the EvaluationLink does not need to be LinkGrammarRelationshipNode,
; it can be anything, and is usually passed as the lg_rel paramter to
; most of these routines.
;
; Let N(wl,wr) denote the number of times that the word-pair (wl, wr) has
; actually been observed; that is, N("some-word", "other-word") for the
; example link above.  Properly speaking, this count is conditioned on
; the LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "Blah", so the correct notation would
; be N(wl, wr | rel)  with rel the relationship.  In what follows, the
; relationship is always assumed to be the same, and is thus dropped.
; (the relationship is passed as the lg_rel parameter everywhere).
;
; The mutual information for a word-pair is defined as follows:  Given
; two words, wl and wr, define three probabilities:
;
;    P(wl,wr) = N(wl,wr) / N(*,*)
;    P(wl,*)  = N(wl,*)  / N(*,*)
;    P(*,wr)  = N(*,wr)  / N(*,*)
;
; The N(*,*), N(wl,*) and  N(*,wr) are wild-card counts, and are defined
; to be sums over all observed left and right counts.  That is,
;
;    N(wl,*) = Sum_wr N(wl,wr)
;    N(*,wr) = Sum_wl N(wl,wr)
;    N(*,*) = Sum_wl Sum_wr N(wl,wr)
;
; These sums are computed, for a given word, by compute-pair-wildcard-counts
; below, and are computed for all words by batch-all-pair-wildcard-counts
; The resulting counts are stored as the 'count' value on the
; CountTruthValue on the EvaluationLink for structures of the form:
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "Blah"
;      ListLink
;         AnyNode "left-word"
;         WordNode "bird"
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "Blah"
;      ListLink
;         WordNode "word"
;         AnyNode "right-word"
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "Blah"
;      ListLink
;         AnyNode "left-word"
;         AnyNode "right-word"
;
; Here, AnyNode plays the role of *.  Thus, N(*,*) is shorthand for the
; last of these triples.
;
; Rather than computing and storing the probabilities P(wl,wr), it is
; more convenient to store the entropy or "log likelihood" of the
; probabilities. Thus, the quantity H(wl,*) = -log_2 P(wl,*) is computed,
; and is stored in the "confidence" slot of the truth value. Note the
; minus sign: the entropy H(wl,*) is positive, and gets larger, the
; smaller P is. Note that the logarithm is base-2.  In the scripts
; below, the phrase 'logli' is used as a synonym for this entropy.
;
; The mutual information between a pair of words is defined as
;
;     MI(wl,wr) = -(H(wl,wr) - H(wl,*) - H(*,wr))
;
; This is computed by the script batch-all-pair-mi below. Again, this
; is stored in the "confidence" slot.  Thus, the "confidence" slot
; stores the entropy, for the wild-card structures, and it stores the
; mutual entropy, aka mutual information, for the pairs.
;
; That's all there's to this. The batch-all-pair-mi is the main entry
; point; its given at the bottom.

; To be precise, the summation is performed relative to the given

; (Link grammar links are encoded with LinkGrammarRelationshipNode's).

;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY"
;      ListLink
;         WordNode "word"

; structures more complex than word-pairs, we will need the matcher...)
; (Err, actually, we *do* use the pattern matcher, but the code would
; be faster and more efficient if we didn't. This should be fixed...)
;
; The match pattern for the right-counts is:
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY"
;      ListLink
;         WordNode "word"
;         VariableNode of type WordNode   ; i.e. a wildcard here.
;
; while that for left-counts is:
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY"
;      ListLink
;         VariableNode of type WordNode  ; i.e. a wildcard on the left.
;         WordNode "bird"
;
; Sums are performed over all matching patterns (i.e. all values of the
; VariableNode).
;
; The resulting sums are stored in the CountTruthValues (on the
; EvaluationLink) of the following structures:
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY"
;      ListLink
;         AnyNode "left-word"

;      ListLink
;         WordNode "word"
;         AnyNode "right-word"

; the required pairs are automatically fetched from SQL backend storage
; in the course of computation.  The wild-card entropies and MI values
; are written back to the database as soon as they are computed, so as
; not to be lost.  The double-nested sums are distributed over all CPU
; cores, using guile's par-for-each, and can thus be very CPU intensive.
; Running this script can take hours, or longer (days?) depending on the
; size of the dataset.  Due to the current nature of the design of the
; atomspace, this script is not very efficient; if you just need to
; count things, writing custom scripts that do NOT use the atomspace would
; almost surely be faster.  We put up with the performance overhead here
; in order to get the flexibility that the atomspace provides.
