; OVERVIEW
; --------
; The scripts below implement a simple spanning-tree parser. The goal
; of this parser is to learn a base set of link-grammar disjuncts.
;
; Input to this should be a single sentence. It is presumed, as
; background, that a large number of word-pairs with associated mutual
; information is already avaialable from the atomspace (obtained
; previously).
;
; The algorithm implemented is a basic minimum spanning tree algorithm.
; Conceptually, the graph to be spanned by the tree is a clique, with 
; with every word in the sentence being connected to every other word.
; The edge-lengths are given by the mutual information betweeen word-pairs
; (although perhaps other metrics are possible; see below).
;
; The spanning tree is then obtained. Finally, disjuncts are created from
; the resulting parse, by looking at how each word is attached to the
; other words.  The disjuncts are then recorded.

; Tokenize the text: take the input sentence, and return a list of the

; this is easy. This also makes a vague attempt to also separate commas,
; periods, and other punctuation.  Returned is a list of words.

; Minimum Spanning Tree parser.
; Given a raw-text sentence, it splits apart the sentence into distinct
; words, and finds an (unlabelled) dependency parse of the sentence, by
; finding a dependency tree that minimizes minus the mutual information.
; A list of word-pairs, together with the associated mutual information,
; is returned.
;
; There are many MST algorithms; the choice was made as follows:
; Prim is very easy; but seems too simple to give good results.
; Kruskal is good, but seems hard to control a no-link-cross constraint. (?)
; Settle on a variant of Borůvka's algo, which seems to be robust,
; and fast enough for the current needs.
;
; The no-links-cross constraint might not be required, see
; R. Ferrer-i-Cancho (2006) “Why do syntactic links not cross?”
; However, that would require changing the metric from mutual information
; to something else, perhaps incorporating the dependency distance
; (as defined by Ferrer-i-Cancho), or possibly the "hubiness", or some
; combination.  Since I really, really want to stick to entropy concepts,
; the mean-dependency-distance metric needs to be re-phrased as some
; sort of graph entropy. Hmmm...
;
; So, for now, a no-links-corss constraint is handed-coded into the algo.
; Without it, it seems that the pair-MI scores alone give rather unruly
; dependencies (unclear, needs exploration).  So, in the long-run, it
; might be better to instead pick something that combines MI scores with 
; mean-dependency-distance or with hubbiness. See, for example:
; Haitao Liu (2008) “Dependency distance as a metric of language
; comprehension difficulty” Journal of Cognitive Science, 2008 9(2): 159-191. 
; or also:
; Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho (2013) “Hubiness, length, crossings and their
; relationships in dependency trees”, ArXiv 1304.4086
