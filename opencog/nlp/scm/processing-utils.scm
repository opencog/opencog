;
; This routine takes plain-text input (in english), and sends it off 
; to a running instance of the RelEx parser, which should be listening 
; on port 4444. The parser will return a set of atoms, and these are
; then loaded into this opencog instance. After import, these are attached
; to the "*new-parsed-sent-anchor*" via a ListLink; the set of newly added
; sentences can be fetched with the "get-new-parsed-sentences" call.

; localhost 127.0.0.1 and port 4444
