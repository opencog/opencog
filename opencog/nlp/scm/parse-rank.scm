; Provide a score for a link-grammar parse, based on the total 
; word-pair mutual information for all word-pairs linked by
; link-grammar links. That is, every link-grammar link is looked
; up in a database of mutual information, and the total MI is
; added up for the indicated parse. It is presumed that a higher
; MI corresponds to a better parse.
;
; An alternate, possibly better(?) strategy, which is not used, is to
; obtain the maximum-spanning-tree for a given sentence, and then
; compare the link-gramar linakge to that tree. (Some initial code
; for the MST approach is below)
;
; Requires access to a database containing previously computed word-pair
; mutual information values.
;
; NOTE ON PRORGRAMMING STYLE: this file makes heavy use of callbacks.
; which is maybe not that good an idea ... its sort of a confusing
; programming style. Maybe should redo this with streams.

; The parse ranker works by adding up the mutual-information scores
; associated with each link-grammar link. The higher the total mutual
; information, the higher the parse is ranked.
;
; Link-grammar structure
; ----------------------
; The code below assumes that opencog contains the link-grammar links 
; describing the parse. The assumed format for these links is as in 
; the following example:
; 
;   (EvaluationLink
;      (LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "EB")
;      (ListLink
;         (WordInstanceNode "consist@79aac665-c59f-41e2-9ab6-af75b768b5c4")
;         (WordInstanceNode "mostly@69de3109-9e54-4acc-8aef-66e9da304078")
;      )
;   )
;
; where "mostly@69de3109-9e54-4acc-8aef-66e9da304078" is a typical 
; word-instance node.

; Consider the set of all pairs of words in a sentence (with the left

; This routine will look up the mutual-information scores for each
; word-pair from a database, and associate that score with the word-pair.
; If there's no score in the database, the word-pair is omitted from
