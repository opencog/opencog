; -- get word of word instance. (word-inst-get-word)
; -- get part-of-speech, lemma of word.
; -- get prepositions
; -- get word senses
; -- deleting all atoms pertaining to a sentence

; Important Design Note: A long-term goal of NLP within opencog is to
; do processing not in scheme, but in OpenCog itself, using pattern
; matching. The reason for this is so that we can apply OpenCog learning
; algos to learn new ways of processing. Many/most of the utilities below
; could be implemented by using pattern maching. Code that depends on these
; utilities should be converted to use pattern matching as soon as reasonable.
; Code that cannot be converted will eventually (in the distant future ...)
; become obsolete.

  delete-sentences       Delete all atoms that occur in sentences

  Delete atoms that belong to particular sentence instances; we don't
  want to clog up the atomspace with old junk we don't want any more.

  Only the atoms in the atomspace are removed; if any are in the
  backingstore (database), they are untouched.

  XXX TODO: In principle, this could be accomplished by lowering the
  AttentionValue for the atoms, and letting the ForgettingAgent do its
  work. In practice, this is too complicated, for now.

  XXX: Some of these nodes & links are needed by the language generation
  pipeline for matching to old sentences, so maybe they cannot be
  removed.
