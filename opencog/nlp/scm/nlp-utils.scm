; Important Design Note: A long-term goal of NLP within opencog is to
; do processing not in scheme, but in OpenCog itself, using pattern
; matching. The reason for this is so that we can apply OpenCog learning
; algos to learn new ways of processing. Many/most of the utilities below
; could be implemented by using pattern maching. Code that depends on these
; utilities should be converted to use pattern matching as soon as reasonable.
; Code that cannot be converted will eventually (in the distant future ...) 
; become obsolete.
