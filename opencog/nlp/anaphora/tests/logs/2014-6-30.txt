1. Fixed gender filters bugs, but there are still some problems:

   For example:

   (1) "Alice always wanted a new boyfriend. Then he bumped into her."
   (2) "Graph has edges, he is good at driving"

   In the first sentence, "he" should refer to "boyfriend".
   In the second sentence, "he" shouldn't refer to "Graph".
   However, there is no indications whether "boyfriend" or "Graph is "masculine" or not.

   This part need extra information and probably reasoning from PLN.

   For tests(17,18,19), after splitting multiple sentences, hobbs agent produced accurate results.
   Passed tests(17,18,19)

2. Added singular-plural filters(10,11,12)

   Note that it is not "singular", so a separate filter(12) for "it" is added.

   Passed tests(6,11)

3. Added reflexive pronoun filters

   Passed tests(4,13)

4. For tests(12,20), after splitting multiple sentences, hobbs agent produced accurate results.

   Although results are the same as results from relation-extractor, they are still wrong since handling "and" relation
   is not supported.
