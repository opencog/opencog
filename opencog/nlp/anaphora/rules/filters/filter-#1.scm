;; antecedent is not "noun" with two exceptions
;; "that" can refer to a verb.
;; "enough" can refer to a verb.

;; Example:

;; "Tom saw an apple under a tree, he ate it."
;; While resolving the pronoun "he" or "it", only "Tom", "apple", "tree" are qualified antencedents.
;;
;; Special cases for "that" and "enough":

;; "I will give him some sedative. That should calm him down." -- "give" is a qualified antecedent for "that".

;; "the children kept fighting till they had enough" -- "fighting" is a qualified antecedent for "enough".
