# AIML in the AtomSpace

## Status
*ATTTENTION* The code here is *MOTHBALLED*.
The reason for this is that there is no compelling AIML content that
is in any way useful to the current plans for OpenCog.  I think that
we've moved past AIML in terms of what we can accomplish.

## Goal
Be able to apply AIML rules, in a fashion that is integrated with the
rest of the OpenCog NLP pipeline.  That is, the AIML rules become just
one more aspect of linguistic processing.  Of curse, traditional AIML
completely short-circuits normal linguistic analysis, and simply finds
some utterance that matches up with an input string of words.  By
integrating with the NLP pipeline, this potentially allows for the
creation of more subtle AIML-like rules, making use of linguistic
information.  It also potentially allows the simulataneous scripting
of speech and behavior.

There are two steps to this process: The import of standard AIML markup
into the AtomSpace, and the application of the imported rules to the
current speech (text-processing) context.

The goal of the import step is to map AIML expressions to equivalent
atomspace graphs, in such a way that the OpenCog pattern matcher can
perform most or all of the same functions that most AIML interpretors
perform. The goal is NOT to re-invent an AIML interpreter in OpenCog!

## Lightning reivew of AIML
Some example sentences.

```
        Input               That Topic     Result
(R1)  Hello                  *     *    Hi there
(R2)  What are you           *     *    I am Hanson Bot
(R3)  What are you thinking  *     *    How much I like you
(R4)  Hi                     *     *    <srai>Hello</srai>
(R5)  I * you                *     *    I <star/> you too.
(R6)  What time is it        *     *    The time is <syscall>
(R7)  *                      *     *    I don't get it.
(R8)  ...                    *     *    <set topic = "animals dog"/>
(R9)  ...                    *     *    <set name="topic">animals dog</set>
(R10) ...                    *     *    <set name="topic"><star/></set>
(R11) ...                    *   "* dog"   ...
(R12) ...                    *     *    I like <get name="topic"/>
(R13) ...                    *     *    I like <bot name="some_key"/>
(R14) Is it a <set>setname</set> ?
(R15) Are you <bot name="key"/> ?
(R16) Are you <set><bot name="species"/></set> ?
```

Future, not a current part of AIML:
```
(F1)  Do you like <topic/> ?
(F2)  Do you like <get name="topic"/> ?
```

### Notes
* Notice that the pattern match of R3 takes precendence over R2.
* srai == send the result back through. ("stimulus-response AI")
* that == what the robot said last time. (just a string)
  A full history of the dialog is kept, it can be refered to ...
  (TBD XXX How ???)
* topic == setable in the result. (just a string)
  topic is just one key in a general key-value store of per-conversation
  key-value pairs.

* star and underscore (`*` `_`) are essentially the same thing; it's an AIML
  implementation detail.
* star means "match one or more (space-separated) words"
  stars are greedy.
* carat and hash (`^` `#`) mean "match zero or more words"
* There is an implicit star at the end of all sentences it is less
  greedy).
* (R11) the wild-card match matches the second of two words in a
  2-word topic.  (TBD XXX what about N words ??)
* (R14) the wild-card match limited to one of a set.

## Pattern Recognition

Implementing AIML efficiently in the atomspace requires that the pattern
matcher be run "in reverse": rather than applying one query to a
database of thousands of facts, to find a small handful of facts that
match the query; we instead apply thousands of queries to a single
sentence, looking for the handful of queries that match the sentence.
That is, AIML is an example of pattern recognition, rather than
querying.  This means that the traditional link types BindLink and
SatisfactionLink are not appropriate; instead, we use the PatternLink
to specify the AIML patterns.

### Globbing

The pattern matcher uses GlobNode to perform globbing.
See `http://wiki.opencog.org/w/GlobNode` for details.
See `glob.scm` for a simple working example.


## OpenCog equivalents
* R1 example.

```
ImplicationLink
   AndLink
      ListLink
         Concept "Hello"
         Glob "$eol"     # rest of the input line
		ListLink
         WordNode "Hi"
         WordNode "there"
```

There is another approach:

I really really * you, darling.
I really really love you, darling.


# AIML tags

The &lt;person&gt; tag gets converted to
```
      (ExecutionOutput
         (DefineSchema "AIML-tag person")
         (ListLink
             (Glob "$star-1")))

```
