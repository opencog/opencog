; This rule is for adjectival intensional complements of certain verbs,
; such as in "He seems to be happy." I'm not sure how it gets assigned; it's
; one of those random things that was here when I got here; I want to point
; out that there are also uses of these verbs with other word-types following them,
; such as "He seems like a nice guy." and "He seems to run the show." So, this rule
; should probably be handled by something more gerneral, but I haven't gotten
; around to it yet.
