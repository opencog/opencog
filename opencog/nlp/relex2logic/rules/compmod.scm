; This rule hooks up a complementizer with the verb it complementizes.
; E.g. "I run if I have energy."  This rule relates "run" to "if"; the _comp
; rule constructs the "if" phrase.  It may be hard to predict when this rule
; will fire because there are other rules for some specific complementizers,
; that work sometimes, and it seems right now, relex is giving _rel sometimes
; when it should give _comp, which doesn't really make any difference . . .
