; This handles adverbs and many adverbial phrases, because I rigged relex to treat a lot of adverbial phrases as adverbs.
; so, for example "She sings well" is treated the same way as "She sings with an accent."  'with an qccent' is treated
; as an adverb.  This is why I changed the individual triadic prepositional relations into two rules each -- one to assign
; the preposition as an adverbial or adjectival or predicate, and the other to assign the object of the preposition.
