; Tihs rule is for sentential complements following propositional attitude verbs, such as
; "I know that you lied to me." or "I imagine you will make a fine garbage man someday, son."
; It hooks up know to that, and imagine to will in the sentences above.
; this relation exists so that someday OpenCog will understand that the situations described
; in the sentences following propositional attitude verbs must be interpreted as 'representations'
; rather than 'reality' which means that you can't infer anything about reality from them.
; look up Jackendoff's writing on this subject if  you wish to understand more . . .
