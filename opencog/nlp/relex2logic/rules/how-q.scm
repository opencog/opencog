; This is the default "how" question, which is how-of-manner, as in "how did you sleep?"
; (AN June 2015)
;
; NB: in order to make this rule work, I have had to retain the classification of "how" as a "PrepositionalRelationshipNode" because that is
; what Relex is putting into the atomspace.  It makes no sense, but since I don't even know where is the code that generates the relex atoms,
; and changing it would probably muck up something else, so I'm just leaving it!
