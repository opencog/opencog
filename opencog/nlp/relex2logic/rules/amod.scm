; NB: there seems to be a bit of a bug in Relex for assigning multiple adjectives to the same noun,
; which works partially -- it seems to get some of the multiple adjectives but not necessarily all
; of them.
;
; This rule treats adjectival phrases as well as adjectives, because I rigged relex that way.  So,
; amod handles "The tall man" and "the man in the hat."  'in the hat' is an adjectival phrase here.
; this is why I changed the individual triadic prepositional relations into two rules, one to assign
; the role of the prepositional phrase and the other to assign the object of the preposition.
