"
  Find answers (i.e., similar sentences that share some keyword) from
  the Atomspace by using the fuzzy pattern matcher. By default, it
  excludes sentences with TruthQuerySpeechAct and InterrogativeSpeechAct.

  Accepts either an actual sentence or a SentenceNode as the input.
  Also accepts an optional argument \"exclude-list\" which is a list of
  atoms that we don't want them to exist in the hypergraphs of the
  answers. By default they are
     (DefinedLinguisticConceptNode \"TruthQuerySpeechAct\")
  and (DefinedLinguisticConceptNode \"InterrogativeSpeechAct\").

  Returns one or more sentences -- the answers.

  For example:
     (get-answers \"What did Pete eat?\")
  OR:
     (get-answers (SentenceNode \"sentence@123\"))

  Possible result:
     (Pete ate apples .)
