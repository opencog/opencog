  to a running instance of the RelEx parser, which should be listening
  on port 4444. The parser will return a set of atoms, and these are
  then loaded into this opencog instance. After import, these are attached
  to the \"*new-parsed-sent-anchor*\" via a ListLink; the set of newly added
  sentences can be fetched with the \"get-new-parsed-sentences\" call.

  The relex-server-host and port are set in config.scm, and default to
  localhost 127.0.0.1 and port 4444

  This version will not wrap R2L atoms inside ReferenceLink.  Using
