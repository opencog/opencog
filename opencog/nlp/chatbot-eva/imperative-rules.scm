; Rules for converting English-langauge imperatives into an
; intermediate, simplified form. 
;
; Language processing runs in multiple steps: the rules here are the
; first step: they convert parsed (link-grammar, relex) sentences into
; a certain ad-hoc simplified intermediate form. Other parts of the
; system then compare that simplified form to the grounded knowledge,
; and extract meaningful robot actions therefrom.
;
; The intermediate form or "simplified form" that these rules generate
; is currently rather poorly defined, and subject to change or even
; complete overhaul.  The simplified form is used only because it is
; too hard to directly match parsed sentences to the grounded knowledge.
;
; The intermediate form is inspired by R2L, but differs from it, mostly
; because R2L is intended for PLN reasoning, whereas the form here is
; intended to be matched to an ontology. Perhaps someday these two forms
; should be merged. Maybe.  Right know, they are not, to avoid breaking
; stuff during development.
;
; Rule-utils needed for defintion of var-decl, etc.

; State and state anchors. These should be thought of as work-arounds,
; to be replaced when a fine-tuned attention-allocation system is
; working.  The anchors serve to define the center of what the
; system is supposed to be "thinking about", right now -- the current
; sentence, the current action to be taken.

; Global state for the current sentence.

; Handle short imperative commands, such as "look up", "look left".
; This is a rule, meant to be applied to the current sentence.
; It will extract a direction to look at, and it will set
; the current-imperative state to that direction.
;
; Relex behaves very inconsistently, sometimes returning
; _advmod(look,left) and sometimes _to-be(look, right)
; when in both cases the correct result would be _to-do(look,left)
; So instead of trusting relex, we are just going to drop back
; to link-grammar, and look for the MVa/Pa link instead.

; Abstracted variant of the above BindLinks. Given an explicit

; a prepostional object, direct object, predicative adjective, etc.
;
; Note that much of this is boilerplate: the SentenceNode, ParseNode,
; and InterpretationNode: this is all more or less cruft, used to make
; up for the fact that attention allocation does not yet work correctly.
; This boilerplate is merely trying to ensure that all the words we
; look at are from the same sentence.  Surely, there must be an easier

; XXX TODO Design notes:
; Rather than hand-crafting a bunch of rules like the above, we should
; do three things:
;
; (1) implement fuzzy matching, so that anything vaguely close to the
;     desired imperative will get matched.
; (2) implement synonymous phrases, rather than listing syonymous verbs
;     explicitly
; (3) implement automated learning of new rules, and refinement of
;     existing rules.
