; Scaffolding for converting English-language imperatives into
; robot actions.  This implements the full end-to-end pipeline,
; of converting English sentences to an intermediate form, matching
; the intermediate form to a grounded-knowledge base, and then
; performing the resulting action, if any.
;
; This handles imperative sentences, such as:
;
;     Eva, look to the right.
;     Look up!
;     Eva, turn to the right.
;     turn left
;     Look down.
;     look straight ahead
;     turn forward
;
;  ("looking" makes here move her eyes only; turning turns he whole head).
;
;     Smile!
;     frown
;     Look sad
;     Look happy
;     Look surprised
;     Look bored
;     Eva, express boredom
;     Eva, show happiness!
;
;
; This is a hard-code ad-hoc pipeline. Subject to change.
