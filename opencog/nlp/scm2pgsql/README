            Helper classes to deal with HUGE .scm files
            -------------------------------------------

This directory contains a couple of classes and programs to help dealing 
with HUGE .scm files. The issue with such files is that compiling them
either in guile or using "guild compile" requires a LOT of RAM.

SCMLoader 
---------

A helper class that implements a simple strategy to load huge .scm files by parsing
each toplevel atom separately and feeding it (with all the inner atoms, in the case 
of links) in an AtomSpace.

PGStorageDelegate
-----------------

A helper class that uses SCMLoader to load a .scm file into an AtomSpace and store
this AtomSpace in a Postgress DB.

Helper executables
------------------

There are also two executable programs.

    scm2pgsql - Expects a .scm file name and the DB credentials and properly read the 
                file and store the resulting AtomSpace into the DB. This program is
                installed by default by "make install". Call it with no args to see 
                a usage message.
    loadscm   - Just crteates an empty AtomSpace and populate it with the contents of
                the passed file before dying. This is useful to test with new .scm files
                and probe the amount of time/RAM required to load them. It is not 
                installed by default. It will be in build/opencog/nlp/scm2pgsql/loadscm
