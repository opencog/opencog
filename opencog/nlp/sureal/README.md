# Surface Realization

Functions for surface realization (SuReal) of output from the
microplanner's output.  The microplanner also uses SuReal to determine
whether a chunk (a set of atoms) can be translated into a sentence;
thus, these two projects are dependent on each other.

Sureal requires Link Grammar, RelEx, and RelEx2Logic outputs.

The main function is `sureal` which takes in a `SetLink` and returns a
sentence.

The words used in the input `SetLink` need to have the corresponding
`WordNode` or `WordInstanceNode` before calling `sureal`.

For example, you can do

```
(nlp-parse "He eats.")
(nlp-parse "He eats quickly.")
(WordNode "she")
(WordNode "drinks")
(sureal (SetLink (EvaluationLink (PredicateNode "drinks") (ListLink (ConceptNode "she")))))
```
which will return all possible sentence is words list, like

```
((she drinks quickly .) (she drinks .))
```
or just
```
((she drinks .)
```
due to some internal algorithm that will stop if it find a "good enough"
solution.

## Algorithm

SuReal does pattern matching on existing sentences in the atomspace.
Existing sentences mean those that were inputed with `(nlp-parse ...)`
calls.  The `nlp-parse` call will uses LG, RelEx, and RelEx2Logic to
generate the necessary atoms.

Especially important is the LG outputs.  For each sentence, a bunch of
links of the style:

```
(EvaluationLink (stv 1.0 1.0)
   (LgLinkInstanceNode "Ds**c@4432ef3-3c4e-42a9-8072-9975d168a12c")
   (ListLink
      (WordInstanceNode "the@da65d87c-22b9-4af2-89f4-60042816c579")
      (WordInstanceNode "man@1a6d58eb-e9c0-4c8e-af01-8d4304e3430c")
   )
)
(LgLinkInstanceLink
   (LgLinkInstanceNode "Ds**c@4432ef3-3c4e-42a9-8072-9975d168a12c")
   (LgConnector
      (LgConnectorNode "D")
      (LgConnDirNode "+")
   )
   (LgConnector
      (LgConnectorNode "Ds**c")
      (LgConnDirNode "-")
   )
)
(ReferenceLink
   (LgLinkInstanceNode "Ds**c@4432ef3-3c4e-42a9-8072-9975d168a12c")
   (LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "Ds**c")
)

```

are generated.  They contain all the information of the LG connectors
used for a particalar word of a particalar sentence.

Given a new `SetLink` as input, SuReal matches each atom in the link to
the structure inside the old sentences.  In addition, for each node that
it matches, it check the word corresponding to the node and see if its
LG disjuncts agree with the usage of the word it is replacing.


## Node & Link

```
(EvaluationLink (stv 1.0 1.0)
   (LgLinkInstanceNode "Ds**c@4432ef3-3c4e-42a9-8072-9975d168a12c")
   (ListLink
      (WordInstanceNode "the@da65d87c-22b9-4af2-89f4-60042816c579")
      (WordInstanceNode "man@1a6d58eb-e9c0-4c8e-af01-8d4304e3430c")
   )
)
```
The `EvaluationLink` above describes one instance of the LG link used
to link the two words in the sentence.

```
(LgLinkInstanceLink
   (LgLinkInstanceNode "Ds**c@4432ef3-3c4e-42a9-8072-9975d168a12c")
   (LgConnector
      (LgConnectorNode "D")
      (LgConnDirNode "+")
   )
   (LgConnector
      (LgConnectorNode "Ds**c")
      (LgConnDirNode "-")
   )
)
```
The `LgLinkInstanceLink` further explain the `EvaluationLink` by
indicating what the original LG connector is.  For example, "the" is
using "D+" to connect with "Ds**c-" of "man".

```
(ReferenceLink
   (LgLinkInstanceNode "Ds**c@4432ef3-3c4e-42a9-8072-9975d168a12c")
   (LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "Ds**c")
)
```
The `ReferenceLink` will just link the LG link instance to a general
version of the LG link.

In addition to the above links, SuReal also uses **LG-Dict** to generate
the disjuncts for each input word in the atomspace.

Note that currently there is also

```
(EvaluationLink (stv 1 0.99999982)
   (LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "Ds**c")
   (ListLink
      (WordInstanceNode "the@da65d87c-22b9-4af2-89f4-60042816c579")
      (WordInstanceNode "man@1a6d58eb-e9c0-4c8e-af01-8d4304e3430c")
   )
)
```
for language learning purposes.
