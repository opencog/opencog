; trivial-promoter -- promote WordInstanceNode to a SemeNode

;
; Return the seme itself.

;
; Given a word instance, compare the WordNode associated with the 
; instance to the WordNode of a SemeNode. Return the first SemeNode
; found; if not found, create a new SemeNode with this word.  So, for
; example, given the existing link
;     LemmaLink 
;         SemeNode "house@a0a2"
;         WordNode "house"
;
; and the input WordInstanceNode "house@45678", it will return the 
; SemeNode "house@a0a2", since it has the same lemma.

; Generic seme promoter. 
;
; Given a word inst, and two routines: a new-seme creation routine, and
; a seme matching routine, this will perform all of the other steps
; required for seme promotion in a "generic" way.
;
; The make-new-seme-proc must accept a word instance as its sole argument,
; and return a single new seme. 
;
; The seme-match-proc? must accepet two arguments: a seme and word-inst,
; and return #t if the word-inst can be understood to be an instance of
; the seme. Else it should return #f.
;
; This routine works by creating a list of "candidate semes" for the
; input word-inst. A "candidate seme" is one that has the same lemma as
; the word-inst.  These candidates are then passed through the 
; seme-match-proc? predicate, to locate one or more possible promotions
; for the word-inst.  If any match, these are returned.
;
; If none of the identified "candidate semes" are accepted by the
; predicate seme-match-proc?, then a brand-new seme is created by 
; invoking make-new-seme-proc, and this brand-new seme is returned.
;
; A (relatively) simple example of the use of this promoter can be found in 
; the same-lemma-promoter-two example, below.

; same-dependency-promoter -- re-use an existing seme if it has a 
; superset of the modifiers of the word instance. Otherwise, create a 
; new seme.  This performs seme promotion for both nouns and verbs,
; looking for noun-modifiers (e.g. _amod) on nouns and looking at 
; subject, object, adverb relations for verbs.
;
; The idea here is that if we have a word instance, such as "ball", and
; a seme "green ball", we can deduce "oh this ball, it must refer to the 
; green ball".  But if the word-instance is "red ball", then it cannot
; be the seme "green ball", and a new seme, specific to "red ball" is
; created. 
;
; Specifically, we try to make sure that *every* modifier to the word-inst
; is also a modifier to the seme. i.e. that the modifiers on the word-inst
; are a subset of the modifiers on the seme. i.e. that the word-inst is 
; "semantically broader" than the seme.  
;
; This is a fairly basic operation, and lacks in many ways: we'd like 
; to do this only for recent words in the conversation, and we'd also like
; to do narrowing, e.g. so if we get "John threw the ball. John threw the 
; blue ball.", we conclude that the ball in the second sentence is the same
; as that in the first. The routine fails to handle this situation.  This
; routine should probably not be "fixed", and instead, a new, more 
; sophisticated promoter should be created.
;
; Anyway, seme promotion should not be done in scheme, but with opencog
; pattern-matching. So, for example, the following ImplicationLink is a 
; step in that direction:
;
; IF   %InheritanceLink(word-inst $word-seme)
;    ^ $modtype (word-inst, $attr-inst)
;    ^ $modtype is _amod or _nn etc.
;    ^ %InheritanceLink($attr-inst $attr-seme)
;    ^ $modtype ($seme, $attr-seme)
;    ^ $seme is a SemeNode
; THEN $modtype($seme, $attr-seme)
;
; When promoting verbs, this promoter is careful to handle the HYP
; and TRUTH-QUERY_FLAG as well.  The README file goes into more detail
; on the how and why of handling these two flags.
;
; As of mid-September 2009, this is working well, and doing the right 
; thing for general question answering.
