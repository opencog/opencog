; Code responsible for updating various openpsi related entities,
; modulators, and parameters based on interaction rules governing the
; dynamic relationships between them.
;
; The interaction rules specify internal dynamic relationships of the form:
; "change in trigger-entity causes change in target-entity with strength s"
; See interaction-rule.scm for more information.
;
; The updater runs in a loop, and, for each change in a trigger entity,
; it will execute every rule containing that trigger as an antecedent.
; Each rule will be executed once, for a given change.
;
; To use:
; (use-modules (opencog openpsi))
; (psi-updater-run)  ; to start the loop
; (psi-updater-halt) ; to stop the loop
;
; If (define logging #t) is set below, then
; > tail -f "psilog.txt"
; can be used to monitor changes in some select events and variables. (It's
; pretty crude.)
;
; Instructions on using this module, including creation of rules and event
; event detection, are in README.md under the section "Modulators and Internal
; Dynamics."

 Adjust psi-related variable based on triggered interaction rule

 Update openpsi parameter and variable values as a functon of the magnitude of
 change in the trigger entity, the current value of the target and the strength
 of the interaction rule. The current value of the target influences the change
 magnitude such that increases in value are larger when the current value is low
 and smaller when the current value is high. (And vica versa for decreases.)

 Currently the implementation assumes the values of openpsi parameters are
 normalized in [0 1]. The values of the params are assumed to be stored
 in a StateLink or if not in a StateLink an attempt is made to evaluate or
 execute the atom to obtain a value (see psi-get-value function). However, this
 representation maybe be changing subject to feedback from those in the know.
