(define-public (psi-rule context action demand-goal a-stv demand-node)
"
  It associates an action and context in which the action has to be taken
  to a goal that is satisfied when the action is executed. It is structured as
  as the following `ImplicationLink`,

    (ImplicationLink
        (AndLink
            (context)
            (action))
        (demand-goal))

  context:
  - A list containing the terms/clauses that should be met for this action
    to be taken. These are atoms that should be evaluated to return
    TRUE_TV/FASLE_TV.

  action:
  - It should be an atom that can be run by `cog-evaluate!`. That means that
    it will have to return TRUE_TV or FALSE_TV. Any atom that could be executed
    by running `(cog-execute! your-action)`.

  demand-goal:
  - It should be an atom that can be run by `cog-evaluate!`. That means that
    it will have to return TRUE_TV or FALSE_TV. This is basically a formula, on
    how this rule affects the demands.

  a-stv:
  - This is the stv of the ImplicationLink.

  demand-node:
  - The node that represents a demand that this rule affects.
