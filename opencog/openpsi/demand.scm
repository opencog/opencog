  Increases or decreases the strength of the demand depending on whether it is

  - The node that represents the demand.

  min-node:
  - A NumberNode for the lower boundary of the range.

  - A NumberNode for the percentage of change that a demand-value be updated
    with, should it pass the boundaries. Must be greater than zero.
