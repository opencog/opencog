                   ----------------

The README contains miscellaneous notes about the atomspace. But first:

What is the Atomspace?
======================
The AtomSpace is a database that holds "term graphs".  The formal
definition of a "term graph" can be found on page 66 of the book
Franz Baader, Tobias Nipkow, "Term Rewriting and All That", Cambridge
University Press, 1998.  What this means is practice is that every atom
in the atomspace is unique: you cannot have two of the "same" atom in
the atomspace.  So, for example, you can create two "identical" atoms
simply by using the C++ new operator, you cannot place both in the
atomspace: putting the second one in returns a copy of the first one.

This implies that the AtomTable::addAtom() method is fairly complicated:
it must be able to detect is that atom being added already exists in the
atomspace.  The addAtom() method implements the "merge proceedure", page
68 of Baader&Nipkow; the soundness of the proceedure is given in theorem
4.4.3.  A lot of the complexity of atoms and te atomspace centers around
trying to make that merge algo efficient.  It is the primary bottleneck
of the system.

The AtomSpace is crudely "distributed", i.e. parts of it can reside on
a networked collection of computers.  It is "crude" because the current
architecture works, but is not somehow magically, blazingly fast.  The
AtomTable holds the local, in-RAM cache of atoms on this computer; the
AtomSpace is a wrapper around the AtomTable, it can go off to other
machines to fetch (and store) atoms if they are not in the local
AtomTable.

The distributed AtomSpace uses UUID's (universally unique identifiers)
to uniquely identify an atom. Due to a historical accident, the UUID's
are stored both in a Handle and in the Atom it refers to. The seems to
be a design error: Handles should not store UUID's; Handles should be
be just a synonym for AtomPtr.  Fixing this will take a lot of work.

Multiple AtomSpaces can be used simultaneously, and AtomSpaces can be
created in a hierarchical fashion.  Thus, the AtomSpace can be thought
of as an "environment" (kind-of like the environment in bash, but
hierarchical, so, more like the environment in Lisp or Scheme.)  The
hierarchical nature means that Links in the child atomspace can refer
to Atoms in the parent atomspace (but not vice-versa).

The AtomSpace API is completely thread-safe. This includes the methods
on class Atom and class TruthValue: these can be accessed by any number
of threads simultaneously. Several unit tests test for this. More about
threading below.

Memory management for Atoms is handled by reference-counting, using the
std::shared_ptr class. This means that you should never use the new()
and delete() operators directly on Atoms or TruthValues. An Atom will
automatically be destroyed when it's reference counter drops to zero.
A prototype using garbage collections (the Boehem GC) was attempted, but
this did not work well, due to the bad interplay between std:: container
classes and weak pointers.  Basically, every atom stores both it's
outgoing set (atoms it points to) and it's incoming set (atoms that
point at it). This means that there are circular loops everywhere. Now,
the Boehm GC can discover circular loops just fine, but only if they are
reasonably short. The problem is that std::set can have pointers to
pointers to pointers, of depth log(N), and N can get quite large,
larger than what bdgc can easily detect. In essence, std::set does not
play nice with bdgc. Bummer. So reference counting is done instead, and
in order to break the circular loops, the incoming set consists of weak
pointers. More about garbage collection below.

                      Adding atom types
                      -----------------

The ClassServer provides a primitive extension mechanism so that
modules/agents/libraries may add new atom types to the default type
hierarchy. In order to ease the task of third-parties wishing to extend
the ClassServer, we provide a cmake macro that generates a set of
files with c++ code that can be used by the module/library.

The macro uses a 'type script' file as input which uses the following
format:

<TYPE> [<- <PARENT_TYPE1>[,<PARENT_TYPE2>,<PARENT_TYPE3>,...]] ["<TYPE_NAME>"]

Where

    TYPE is an identifier that will be used in your code to reference
    the type's numeric code. Usually, it is defined using capital
    letters and underscores as its semantics is close to that of C/C++
    constant.

    PARENT_TYPE1, PARENT_TYPE1, PARENT_TYPE2 are optional identifiers of
    the parent types of the defined type. When more than one parent type
    is specified, they must be separated by commas.

    TYPE_NAME is a string that will be used to identify the type. If
    none is supplied, the cmake macro will generate one based on the
    type's identifer using camel-casing patterns (for instance,
    CUSTOM_NODE would be named "CustomNode").

Above is a short snippet of valid script entries. For more examples,
check the atom_types.script file.

ATOM
NODE <- ATOM
LINK <- ATOM
WORD_NODE <- NODE
CONCEPT_NODE <- NODE "OddlyNamedNode"
ASSOCIATIVE_LINK <- LINK "AssocL"
EVALUATION_LINK <- LINK "EvalLink"
MULTIPARENT_LINK <- ASSOCIATIVE_LINK_LINK,EVALUATION_LINK "MPLink"

-----
To process the 'atom types' script file, one must add the macro
OPENCOG_ADD_ATOM_TYPES to the CMakeLists.txt and the header file to the
list of source files:

# CMakeList.txt
OPENCOG_ADD_ATOM_TYPES(atom_types.script atom_types.h atom_types.definitions atom_types.inheritance)

ADD_LIBRARY(sample SHARED
    atom_types.h
    Sample1.cc
    Sample2.cc
    ...
)

The macro OPENCOG_ADD_ATOM_TYPES expects 4 parameters:

    1. the filename of the script file that will be used as input
    2. the filename of the header file that will be generated with
       the identifiers of the new atom types.
    3. the filename of the definitions file that will be generated with
       the instantiations of the variables that will store the new atom
       types.
    4. the filename of the inheritance file that will be generated with
       the set of method invocations that will build the type hierarchy
       inside the ClassServer.

To properly *use* the generated files, the following conventions should be
followed:

  * include the definitions file right after the standard '#include'
    statement of the file with the code that initializes your module/agent/library.

  * include the inheritance file *inside the body* of the routine
    initializing the module/agent/library.

  * include the header file by any files that references the identifier
    of the a new atom type.

For instance:

// MyModule.cc
#include "MyModule.h"
#include "AnotherHeader.h"
#include "atom_types.definitions"
MyModule::MyModule() {}
...
static __attribute__ ((constructor)) void _init(void)
{
    #include "atom_types.inheritance"
}


// AnotherFile.cc
#include "AnotherFile.h"
#include "atom_types.h"
#include "YetAnotherFile.h"

void AnotherFile::someMethod() {
    ...
    std::string name = opencog::ClassServer::getTypeName(opencog::MYNODE);
    ...
}

                   Garbage Collection Design
                   -------------------------

As of October/November 2013, Handles use std::shared_pointer to deal
with memory management, and so using GC is no longer urgent.  The
shared_pointers seem to work OK, for now.  Based on performance
measurements, however, shared pointers are 3x slower than GC could be
(compare the AtomTable results for April and November 2013 in the
opencog/benchmark/diary.txt file, which show a rough 3x slowdown.)

Without garbage collection (or smart pointers) it becomes unsafe to use
bare pointers in a multi-threaded environment.  With garbage collection
(or smart pointers), and a reasonably good design and coding style, the
use of bare pointers in a multi-threaded environment becomes safe. In
what follows, smart poiners will not be considered because they are
(1) generally slower (2) use significantly more RAM (40 bytes per
pointer, instead of 8 bytes, as well as additional bytes for the
counter itself.)

The smart-pointer design takes into account the cyclic references in
the IncomingSet by using std::weak_ptr there.  This is a potential
stubling block for GC as well (?? or is it? Not sure, mayb Boehm
deals with islands just fine.)

TODO:
-- Conditionally add boehm GC
-- Convert outgoing set to hold Atom* (Done, Sept 2013)
-- Add locks to getHandleSet (Done, October 2013)
-- Add threading to benchmark

                       Threading Design
                       ----------------

As of November 2013, all atomspace operations should be thread-safe.
This includes all AtomSpace API calls, and all public methods on Atoms,
Links, Nodes, truth and attention values.  Thread-safety is mildly
tested in AtomSpaceAsyncUTest but more robust threading tests would be
great.  In addition, comprehensive multi-threaded benchmarks are sorely
needed.

The AtomTable::getHandlesByXXX() methods offer a great opportunity for
adding parallelism.  Currently, they use std::copy_if(), which can be
replaced by OMP_ALGO versions, and including oc_omp.h. For examples on
how this is done in practice, grep the moses code. Its actually quite
very easy; I haven't done so out of laziness mostly (and the greedy
desire for a benchmark).

The AtomTable uses a single global lock, and it potentially causes
significant contention in a highly-threaded environment. This could be
fixed by converting it to a reader-writer lock, using readers for the
getHandles calls, and writer for the add/remove Atom calls.

The atoms are all using a per-atom lock, and thus should have no
contention (although this is a bit RAM-greedy, but what the heck --
the alternative of one global lock would be a huge bottleneck.)

The ClassServer() uses a reader-writer lock when fetching info.
If would be great to make this lockless somehow, since, realistically,
absolutely no one ever adds new atom types, once the cogserver has been
initialized. i.e. we're using a lock to protect a case that never
happens in real life.
