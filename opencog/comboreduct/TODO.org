* ComboReduct
** Code Improvements
- [ ] add a dummy action/perception vocabulary to not use
  ant_vocabulary when it is not necessary
- [ ] moved ant evaluator as part of the ant vocabulary definition
- [ ] have eval-table detects automatically if the input file has a header
- [ ] unify partial and complete truth table
- [ ] it seems the operator== in vertex.h are not passing by reference
  and copy instead maybe this isn't optimal
- [ ] +(-0.25 *(-1.5 $8) *(0.5 +(1 $5)) $2 $7)
   and
   +(0.25 *(-1.5 $8) *(0.5 $5) $2 $7) 
   are equivalent but not reduced
- [ ] the following programs are quivalent yet how to reduce them
  or(and(or(!$1 $3) !$2) and(!$1 $3))
  and(or(and(!$2 $3) !$1) or(!$2 $3))
  or(and(or(!$1 !$2) $3) and(!$1 !$2))
- [ ] reduce_to_enf does not assume one is working on a subtree
- [ ] reduce_from_assumptions::implies is abnormally long, surely the
  code can be simplified
- [ ] in mixed_reduction (and probably full_reduction as well) the
  reduction strategy is recalled everytime since it is not in the
  constructor
- [ ] move CaseBasedBoolean table under comboreduct/comno/table.[h|cc]
- [ ] simplify *_reduction.cc to avoid redundant rule def following
  contin_reduction.cc
- [ ] rename comboreduct/combo/vertex.h by combo_vertex or something,
      same for the class and so on.
- [ ] try to replace id::logical_true and id::logical_false by C++ boolean
  Note: it is difficult to do due to some ambiguity conflicts
** Ideas
- [ ] add a cache to reduct engine (preliminary test on that suggests
  it doesn't work that well)
