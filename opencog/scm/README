This repository contains assorted routines, written in scheme, for manipulating
OpenCog atoms and systems, in various general ways. These utilities include:

-- debug.scm
   + debugger/backtrace support.

-- file-utils.scm
   + list files in directory
   + load scheme code from file
   + execute scheme code from a string or a port.

-- persistence.scm
   + store, fetch groups of atoms from persistent store.

-- utilities.scm
   + increment a CountTruthValue
   + delete an OpenCog hypergraph, from the top-node downards
   + get all atoms of a certain given type
   + get all incoming/outgoing atoms of a given type
   + apply filter to a list of atoms
   + get "partner" atoms connected by links in various ways

In addition, there are some examples:

-- example-dbi.scm: How to use the dbi interface to access SQL tables.


WIRES
-----
The "wires" directory contains a currently abandoned, but interesting
implementation of a "constraint propagation system", wherein OpenCog 
hypergraphs are treated like electrical circuits, with interactions
flowing between them. The idea may be worth resurrecting, although
currently there's no strong motivation.
