/** Diffuses short term importance between atoms in the attentional focus.
 *
 * Diffusion sources consist of all atoms that are in the attentional focus.
 *
 * Supports two types of importance diffusion:
 *
 * (1) Diffusion to atoms that are incident to each atom, consisting of that
 *     atom's incoming and outgoing sets (excluding hebbian links)
 *
 * (2) Diffusion to atoms that are adjacent to each atom, where the type of
 *     the connecting edge is a hebbian link
 *
 * Please refer to the detailed description of this agent in the README file,
 * where an extensive explanation of the algorithm, features and pending
 * work is explained.
