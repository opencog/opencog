/** The ForgettingAgent, carries out the forgetting process in OpenCog Prime. 
 * 
 * It does based on the LTI of Atoms. Low LTI indicates that an atom has not been
 * of any use for a long time, and additionally, isn't near any other important
 * atoms. The latter condition is because the ImportanceSpreadingAgent would
 * otherwise increase the STI of the atom, by moving STI from nearby important
 * atoms, and increase the likelihood of the atom in question being:
 *
 * 1. used in mind processes, and thus
 * 2. rewarded with stimulus which later gets exchanged for STI. 
 *
 * The ForgettingAgent also takes into account the VLTI of an atom. This is a
 * boolean value that indicates whether the atom in fact is allowed to be
 * forgotten. This allows a mechanism for ensuring that highly important
 * information will never be forgotten, even if it's used only very very rarely.
 *
 * Forgetting can be tuned via two parameters:
 *
 * 1. The ammount of Atoms the AtomSpace should contain.
 * 2. A range value of what is an accepteable deviation from that. (Allows the agent to run less often and delete more atoms in one go)
 *
 * These work in concert to limit how much and what atoms are forgotten.
 * TODO: Improve Recursive Remove to work with links outher then HebbianLinks
