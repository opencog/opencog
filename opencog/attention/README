Changes made to the Old syste:

Currently only AsymmetricHebbianLinks are used. They can act like AsymmetricHebbianLink and a InverseAsymmetricHebbianLink combined. All Agents asumme the Outgoing set of these Links has a size of 2.

Most of the new Agents are based on a stochastic algorithm. They randomly pick an Atom and the do something with it (spread STI,charege rent, ...) this allows us to run them continuasly in the background.
