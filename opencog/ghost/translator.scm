(define (order-terms TERMS)
"
  Order the terms in the intended order, and insert wildcards into
  appropriate positions of the sequence.
  No operation is needed if the pattern is supposed to be matched in
  any order.
  Finally make sure there is no meaningless consecutive
  wildcard/variable in the term list we are going to return, as that
  may cause a glob to be grounded in an unintentional way.
