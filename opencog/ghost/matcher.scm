;; This is the GHOST action selector for finding and deciding
;; which action should be executed at a particular point in time.

(define* (eval-and-select RULES #:optional (SKIP-STI #f))
"
  This is the goal-driven action selection.

  Evaluate the candidates and see which of them, if any, satisfy the
  current context, and then select one of them based on their weights.

  The weight of an action will be calculated in this way:
  Wa = 1/Na * sum(Wcagi)

  Na = number of satisfied rules [i] that have the action [a]
  Wcagi = Scag * Sc * Icag * Ug

  Scag = Strength of the psi-rule (c âˆ§ a => g)
  Sc = Satisfiability of the context of the psi-rule
  Icag = Importance (STI) of the rule
  Ug = Urge of the goal

  SKIP-STI is for backward compatibility, used to decide whether to
  include STI of a rule (Icag) in action selection or not. It's needed
  as the default STI is zero. So if one runs GHOST without running
  ECAN (as the earlier version of GHOST permits) then no action will
  ever be triggered.
