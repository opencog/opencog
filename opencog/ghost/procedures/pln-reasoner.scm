;;
;; Very simplistic and hacky at the moment, loop of 2 rules
;;
;; 1. Preprocessing to turn r2l outputs into something that PLN can reason on
;;
;; 2. Limited induction reasoning
;;
;; The reasoner doesn't use the URE. Instead if merely applies the 2
;; rules one after the other in a loop.
;;
;; You may test it as following (wait for a couple seconds between
;; each command to be sure that the chatbot-psi and the pln-reasoner
;; have time to diggest them.
