/**
 * Router is not supposed to be used directly by OpenCog (OC)
 * entities. All communication with it should be performed by
 * NetworkElement's (NE) internals. NE encapsulates the protocol used
 * to communicate with Router but in the case you want/need to
 * simulate a NE communicating directly with the router, you may find
 * useful the protocol description provided below.
 *
 * There are five relevant use cases for the protocol:
 *
 * (1) YourEntity starts a handshake with router to enter OC network
 * (no authentication is required at this point. It is just to allow
 * other entities to know about YourEntity)
 *
 * (2) YourEntity wants to send a Message to some other entity (it
 * will always contact the router to do so, regardless who is the
 * actual target for that message).
 *
 * (3) YourEntity is asynchronously notified by router that there are
 * unread messages to it waiting in router's queue. YourEntity will
 * need to be listening to a given port to receive such a message.
 *
 * (4) YourEntity decides it wants to retrieve unread messages from
 * router so it sends a proper request (this request will be answered
 * asynchronously by router).
 *
 * (5) YourEntity is asynchronously contacted by the router to receive
 * requested unread messages. YourEntity will need to be listening to
 * a given port to receive the messages.
 *
 * (1)
 *
 * Router listens to the port 16312.
 * Open a connection to this port and send the following command:
 *
 * LOGIN <YOUR_ENTITY> <ip> <port>
 *
 * All communication is performed in line-based protocol. So
 * everything should go with an explicit '\\n'. (this is true from
 * every command or data line). YOUR_ENTITY is a literal string used
 * to identify YourEntity in OC network. <ip> and <port> will be used
 * to connect to your entity.  Please use ports > 16326 (obviously
 * 16312 is already taken).
 *
 * router will answer in the same connection with
 *
 * OK
 *
 * or an error message. Then you can just close the connection.
 *
 * (2)
 *
 * Open a connection to router
 * send the command:
 *
 * NEW_MESSAGE <from> <to> <type> <no. lines>
 *
 * <from> and <to> are the string id of source/target. <from> will be
 * YOUR_ENTITY <to> may be either SPAWNER or any othe OC element you
 * want to contact <type> is message type, e.g. type = 1 is
 * stringMessage.  <no. lines> is the number of lines in your
 * message. All messages are broken into lines and sent line by line
 * (lines should not be larger than 1024 chars).
 *
 * So send each line of message.
 *
 * So router will answer with (if NO_ACK_MESSAGES isn't set to true)
 *
 * OK
 *
 * or an error message. The message is sent. You can close connection.
 *
 * (3)
 *
 * YourEntity is supposed to be listening to the port passed in
 * handshake. If no_msg_arrival_notification is set to true, then
 * those steps are skipped and the message is directly send (see
 * (5)). Otherwise the router will connect to this port and send:
 *
 * cNOTIFY_NEW_MESSAGE <no. of messages>
 *
 * the prefix 'c' is not a typo :-)
 *
 * (4) YourEntity decides it want to retrieve unread messages. It will
 * connect to router's port and send:
 *
 * REQUEST_UNREAD_MESSAGES YOUR_ENTITY <limit>
 *
 * <limit> is the maximum number of messages you expect to be retrieved. -1
 * makes it to retrieve all unread messages. So router may answer
 *
 * OK
 *
 * or an error message. YourEntity closes the connection.
 *
 * (5) router connects to YourEntity's port and send:
 *
 * cSTART_MESSAGE <from> <to> <type>
 *
 * then routers sends one or more lines of data (the message itself),
 * note that each data line is prefixed with 'd'.  Then the router
 * sends either:
 *
 * cSTART_MESSAGE <from> <to> <type>
 *
 * To start sending another message. Or:
 *
 * cNO_MORE_MESSAGES
 *
 * to denote that all messages have been sent already.
 *
 * An important warning is that YourEntity should not request message
 * retrieving if it was not notified first about new messages to it in
 * router. The C++ interface provide this automatically but you must
 * take care of it as you are bypassing the interface.
 *
 * (6) Router connects to YourEntity's port (creating a second socket
 * for control) and send:
 *
 * cAVAILABLE_ELEMENT <elementId>
 * or
 * cUNAVAILABLE_ELEMENT <elementId>
 *
 * to indicate a specific Network Element became available or unavailable
