/**
 * @class
 *
 * @brief Customized device for delivering messages via zeromq 
 *
 * @note 
 *
 * Plaza is a Spanish word related to "field" which describes an open urban 
 * public space, such as a city square (see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza).
 * 
 * Each OAC holds a Plaza which provides a public field that all the mind agents 
 * can publish their specific messages there with respective sockets. While subscribers,
 * such as a visualization monitor can easily get these messages within Plaza. 
 * 
 * Technically speaking, each mind agent that wants to send messages should have its own 
 * socket and publish its messages to a specific endpoint. All the mind agents share the
 * same context but not the socket and endpoint, because socket is not thread safe and
 * endpoint is of exclusive resource. 
 *
 * Then the Plaza within OAC would subscribe all the messages from all the mind agents 
 * and then forward them to a single endpoint. 
 *
 * Finally subscribers can access all the messages published by the mind agents via either 
 * the unified endpoint provided by the Plaza or the endpoint provided by the specific 
 * mind agent. The first approach seems more elegant while if efficiency really matters,
 * you can also choose the latter one. 
 *
 * Within mind agents: 
 *                                            _______
 * mind agent 1 (socket 1) => end point 1 => |       |
 * mind agent 2 (socket 2) => end point 2 => | Plaza | => Unified end point P
 * mind agent 3 (socket 3) => end point 3 => |_______| 
 * ...             ...        ...               
 * 
 * For subscribers (either approach works): 
 *
 * Approach 1 (more elegant, recommend): 
 *  _______                             --------------------------------------
 * |       |                           | => subscriber a (socket a, filter a) |
 * | Plaza | => Unified end point P => | => subscriber b (socket b, filter b) | 
 * |_______|                           | ...                                  |
 *                                      --------------------------------------
 *                                                        
 * Approach 2 (only when efficiency matters):
 *
 * end point 1 => subscriber c (socket c)
 * end point 2 => subscriber d (socket d) 
 * ...
