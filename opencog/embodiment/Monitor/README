Workbench for OpenCog, currently supports OpenPsi architecture.

It is designed to interact with OpenPsi system and AtomSpace(Blueprint).
Currently, workbench has three modules: Psi Monitor Browser, Dialog system and Psi
Emotion Space. Within the modules, Psi monitor is now ready and the other two are under 
development.
