ABOUT DeSTIN-E
--------------------------

DeSTIN: A Scalable Deep Learning Architecture with Application to High-Dimensional Robust Pattern Recognition
Deep SpatioTemporal Inference Network (DeSTIN)


INSTALLATION
--------------------------
Dependencies:
 * CMake 2.8 or higher (http://www.cmake.org)
 * Pugixml (http://www.pugixml.org)
 * CUDA 4.0 (http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_download.html)

Windows
 * run cmake to create you Visual Studio solution. (Don't make the output folder the same as the source)

Linux
 * cmake CMakeLists.txt && make
 * ./DestinCuda should now be avalible
 
Mac
 * can someone with a mac fill this one might be the same as linux


CONFIGURATION
--------------------------
 * CUDA port is configured for 1.3 using: nvcc -arch=sm_13 (4X Tesla T10 Processor with a Compute Capability of 1.3)
 * This value is set in CMakeLists.txt with  set(CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS ...)
 * This list of Compute Capability for each Nvidia card is here: http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus


CONFLICTS/KNOW ISSUES
--------------------------
 * Cause of use 1.X compute capability Linear memory addres space is 32-bit

 TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS
-------------------------
 * Update your OS. Works with Ubuntu 11.10
 * Update your Nvidia Drivers. If multiple versions are available, try other recent version.
 * Watch for warnings in the output of `cmake`, especially regarding possible library conflicts, and move the potential conflicts out of the way.
 * If using OpenCV webcam support, get current source code for OpenCV and make sure the required files are in your gcc PATH. You can export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH for example:
   ** export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="/usr/local/lib/opencv/include/"
 * Delete CMakeCache.txt and re-run cmake after making changes to your system, such as dependency paths.
 * Report issues to destin@opencog.org
