/**
 * Abstract class to be inherited to use a learning algo in the context
 * of petaverse imitation learning, the inherited class will be used by
 * ImitationLearningTask and provides the methods needed by the EntropyFilter
 * and ActionFilter to determine the set of atomic actions and perceptions
 * involved in imitation learning. The operator set is still requiered to
 * compute sizePenalty function in the fitness estimator. It should contain
 * only non action, non perception, non indefinite_object operators.
