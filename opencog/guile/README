                        Scheme Scripting
                        ----------------
                    Linas Vepstas, May 2008


This directory contains an implementation of the Scheme shell for the
OpenCog server.  Scheme is a dialect of Lisp; the shell allows scheme
code to manipulate the contents of an OpenCog AtomSpace.  

This binding is intended to be used for day-to-day maintenance
activities, experimentation, and MindAgent development.  The shell is
implemented in [http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html guile]; 
the [http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/ guile reference manual
is here]. The best book on the Scheme programming language (never-mind
the language, it's one of the best books written on programming, no
matter what language you like to use) is 
"[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html Structure and 
Interpretation of Computer Programs"] by Abelson and Sussman. It is now
available online for free from MIT Press.

Documented below are the core interface functions implemented by the
guile binding -- these provide for the creation and deletion of OpenCog
Nodes, Links, TruthValues and VersionHandles, as well as ways to get 
properties (such as the names of Nodes, or the outgoing sets of Links).  
Although the core interface is documented below, it is important to notice
that scheme makes "syntactic sugar" very easy to use.  Some default sugar
is provided in order to make the creation of typed atoms extremely easy.
Atom creation can be as simple as the following example:

   (ReferenceLink (stv 0.987 0.234)
       (ConceptNode "dog-instance-1") (WordNode "dog"))

which creates a link connnecting a concept node and a word node, having
a simple truth value. Any valid node or link name can be used in this way.

A number of utilities and handy functions can be found in the directory
''opencog/scm''. These should be automatically loaded during cog-server
startup, as they are enumerated in lib/opencog.conf.  Additional
NLP-related utilities and MindAgents are located in ''opencog/nlp/scm''; 
not all of these are automatically loaded, but can be manually loaded by
running ''opencog/nlp/scm/load-nlp.sh''.

Much of this README is reproduced at http://opencog.org/wiki/Scheme

== Running ==
--------------
The shell may be invoked by typing "scm" at the opencog prompt; however,
the shell is available only if 1) opencog has been compiled with guile
support, and 2) the scheme shell module is loaded!  To load the module,
start the opencog server as follows:

  bin/opencog/server/cogserver -c lib/opencog.conf

The "opencog.conf" file specifies a bunch of defaults for the opencog
server, including modules that need to be loaded.  If the module has
been loaded, then typing "help" at the opencog prompt should list "scm"
as one of the possible commands.

To get to the opencog shell, say 

   telnet localhost 17001

or 

   rlwrap telnet localhost 17001

This second form will provide an editable command-line history.

To leave the shell, place a single . on the line, and hit enter.
Alternately, hit ^D.


== Core Functions ==
--------------------
The following are the "core" functions, implemented in the guile-to-C++
interface.

=== cog-new-node node-type node-name ===
      Create a new node of the given type and name

      Optionally, a truth value and/or an attention value can follow
      the node name.

      Throws errors if node-type is not a valid atom type for a node,
      and if node-name is not a string.

      Example:
          ; Create a new node, and prints its value:
          guile> (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "some node name")
          #<node[3:some node name] sti:(0,0) tv:(0.000000,0.000000)>

          ; Creates a new node, with a truth value:
          guile> (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "another node"
                        (cog-new-stv 0.8 0.9))
          #<node[3:another node] sti:(0,0) tv:(0.800000,0.900000)>


=== cog-node node-type node-name ===
      Returns the node of the given type and name, if it exists, else
      returns null.

      Optionally, a truth value and/or attention value can follow the
      node name. If the node exists, then the truth value and/or 
      attention value is modified.

      Throws errors if node-type is not a valid atom type for a node,
      and if node-name is not a string.

      Example:
          ; Check to see if a node exists: 
          guile> (cog-node 'ConceptNode "asdf")
          ()

          ; Verify that the return value is actually a true null:
          guile> (null? (cog-node 'ConceptNode "asdf"))
          #t 

          ; Now, create the node, and see if it exists:
          guile> (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "asdf")
          #<node[3:asdf] sti:(0,0) tv:(0.000000,0.000000)>
          guile> (null? (cog-node 'ConceptNode "asdf"))
          #f

          ; Change the truth value of an existing node:
          guile> (cog-node 'ConceptNode "asdf" (cog-new-stv 0.8 0.9))
          #<node[3:some node name] sti:(0,0) tv:(0.800000,0.900000)>


=== cog-new-link link-type atom ... atom ===
      Create a new link, with the given atoms in the link.

      Optionally, a truth value or an attention value can be included
      in the list of atoms.

      Throws errors if the link type is not a valid opencog link type,
      or if any of the arguments after the link type are not atoms,
      truth values, attention values, or nil.

      Example:
          ; Creates two nodes, and a new link:
          guile> (define x (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
          guile> (define y (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "def"))
          guile> (cog-new-link 'Link x y)
          #<link[2 sti:(0,0) tv:(0.000000,0.000000) <[3 abc],[3 def]>]>

          ; Create a new link with a truth value:
          guile> (cog-new-link 'Link x y (cog-new-stv 0.7 0.8))
          #<link[2 sti:(0,0) tv:(0.700000,0.800000) <[3 abc],[3 def]>]>

=== cog-link link-type atom ... atom ===
      Returns the link of the given type and list of atoms, if it
      exists, else returns null.

      Optionally, a truth value or attention value can be included 
      in the list of atoms. If the link exists, then the truth value 
      and/or attention value is modified.

      Throws errors if the link type is not a valid opencog link type,
      or if any of the arguments after the link type are not atoms,
      truth values, attention values, or nil.

      Example:
          ; Create two nodes:
          guile> (define x (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
          guile> (define y (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "def"))

          ; Does a node with these two links exist?
          guile> (cog-link 'Link x y)
          ()

          ; Now, create such a link
          guile> (cog-new-link 'Link x y)
          #<link[2 sti:(0,0) tv:(0.000000,0.000000) <[3 abc],[3 def]>]>

          ; Check again for existence:
          guile> (cog-link 'Link x y)
          #<link[2 sti:(0,0) tv:(0.000000,0.000000) <[3 abc],[3 def]>]>

          ; Change the truth value of an existing node:
          guile> (cog-link 'Link x y (cog-new-stv 0.7 0.8))
          #<link[2 sti:(0,0) tv:(0.700000,0.800000) <[3 abc],[3 def]>]>


=== cog-delete atom ===
      Delete the indicated atom, but only if it has no incoming links.

      Returns #t if the atom was deleted, else returns #f if not deleted.

=== cog-delete-recursive atom ===
      Delete the indicated atom, and all atoms that point at it.

      Both functions return #t on success, else they return #f.
      If #f is returned, then the delete failed.

      Example:
         ; Define two nodes and a link between them:
         guile> (define x (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
         guile> (define y (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "def"))
         guile> (define l (cog-new-link 'Link x y))

         ; Verify that there's an atom called x:
         guile> x
         #<node[3:abc] sti:(0,0) tv:(0.000000,0.000000)>

         ; Try to delete x. This should fail, since there's a link
         ; containing x. 
         guile> (cog-delete x)
         #f

         ; Delete x, and everything pointing to it. This should delete
         ; both x, and the link l.
         guile> (cog-delete-recursive x)
         #t

         ; Verify that the link l is gone:
         guile> l
         Invalid handle

         ; Verify that the node x is gone:
         guile> x
         Invalid handle

         ; Verify that the node y still exists:
         guile> y
         #<node[3:def] sti:(0,0) tv:(0.000000,0.000000)>


=== cog-atom? exp ===
      Return #t if exp is an atom, else return #f

      Example:
         ; Define a node
         guile> (define x (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
         guile> (define y (+ 2 2))
         guile> (cog-atom? x)
         #t
         guile> (cog-atom? y)
         #f


=== cog-node? exp ===
      Return #t if exp is an node, else return #f

      See also cog-node, which will check to see if a specific node
      already exists.

      Example:
         ; Define a node and a link
         guile> (define x (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
         guile> (define y (cog-new-link 'ListLink x))
         guile> (cog-node? x)
         #t
         guile> (cog-node? y)
         #f


=== cog-link? exp ===
      Return #t if exp is an link, else return #f

      See also cog-link, which will check to see if a specific link
      already exists.

      Example:
         ; Define a node and a link
         guile> (define x (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
         guile> (define y (cog-new-link 'ListLink x))
         guile> (cog-link? x)
         #f
         guile> (cog-link? y)
         #t


=== cog-name atom ===
      Return the name of the node. If the atom is not a node, 
      returns NIL.

      Example:
         ; Define a node
         guile> (define x (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
         guile> (cog-name x)
         "abc"


=== cog-type atom ===
      Return the type of the atom. 

      Example:
         ; Define a node
         guile> (define x (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
         guile> (cog-type x)
         ConceptNode
         guile> (eq? 'ConceptNode (cog-type x))
         #t

=== cog-arity atom ===
      Return the arity of the atom.

      Example:
         guile> (define x (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
         guile> (cog-arity x)
         0
         guile> (define l (cog-new-link 'Link x x x))
         guile> (cog-arity l)
         3


=== cog-incoming-set atom ===
=== cog-outgoing-set atom ===
      Return the incoming and outgoing sets, respectively, of the atom.
      These sets are returned as ordinary scheme lists.

      Example:
         ; Define two nodes and a link between them:
         guile> (define x (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
         guile> (define y (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "def"))
         guile> (define l (cog-new-link 'Link x y))

         ; Get the incoming sets of nodes x and y (which is the link l):
         guile> (cog-incoming-set x)
         (#<link[2 sti:(0,0) tv:(0.000000,0.000000) <[3 abc],[3 def]>]>)
         guile> (cog-incoming-set y)
         (#<link[2 sti:(0,0) tv:(0.000000,0.000000) <[3 abc],[3 def]>]>)

         ; Verify that the both incoming sets are really one and the
         ; same link:
         guile> (equal? (cog-incoming-set x) (cog-incoming-set y))
         #t

         ; The returned values are lists, and not singleton atoms.
         ; Thus, the incoming set of x is a list containing l:
         guile> (equal? (cog-incoming-set x) (list l))
         #t

         ; Verify that the returned value is a true list:
         guile> (list? (cog-incoming-set x))
         #t


=== cog-atom handle ===
      Reference the atom identified by the integer-valued handle
=== cog-handle atom ===
      Return the handle (which is an integer) of the atom

      It may be useful to remember that scheme indicates hexadecimal
      numbers by preceeding them with #x, and so, for example, 
      (cog-atom #x2c949b) gets the handle associated with hex 2c949b.

      Example:
         ; Create two atoms, and get thier handles:
         guile> (define x (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
         guile> (define y (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "def"))
         guile> (cog-handle x)
         113
         guile> (cog-handle y)
         114

         ; Get the atom corresponding to handle number 114
         guile> (cog-atom 114)
         #<node[3:def] sti:(0,0) tv:(0.000000,0.000000)>

         ; Verify that handles are truly integers
         guile> (integer? x)
         #f
         guile> (integer? (cog-handle x))
         #t


=== cog-new-stv mean confidence ===
      Create a SimpleTruthValue with the given mean and confidence.
      Unlike atoms, truth values are ephemeral: they are automatically
      garbage-collected when no longer needed.

      Throws errors if mean and confidence are not floating-point
      values.
      Example:
          ; Create a new simple truth value:
          guile> (cog-new-stv 0.7 0.9)

=== cog-new-ctv mean confidence count ===
      Create a CountTruthValue with the given mean, confidence and count.
      Unlike atoms, truth values are ephemeral: they are automatically
      garbage-collected when no longer needed.

      Throws errors if mean, confidence and count are not floating-point
      values.
      Example:
          ; Create a new count truth value:
          guile> (cog-new-ctv 0.7 0.9 44.0)

=== cog-new-itv lower upper confidence ===
      Create an IndefiniteTruthValue with the given lower, upper and confidence.
      Unlike atoms, truth values are ephemeral: they are automatically
      garbage-collected when no longer needed.

      Throws errors if lower, upper and confidence are not floating-point
      values.
      Example:
          ; Create a new indefinite truth value:
          guile> (cog-new-itv 0.7 0.9 0.6)

=== cog-tv? exp ===
      Return #t if exp is a truth value, else return #f

      Example:
         ; Define a simple truth value
         guile> (define x (cog-new-stv 0.7 0.9))
         guile> (define y (+ 2 2))
         guile> (cog-tv? x)
         #t
         guile> (cog-tv? y)
         #f

=== cog-stv? exp ===
      Return #t if exp is a SimpleTruthValue, else return #f

                      (cog-new-stv 0.2 0.5)))
         guile> (cog-tv x)
         (stv 0.2 0.5)
         guile> (cog-tv? (cog-tv x))
         #t

=== cog-set-tv! atom tv ===
      Set the truth-value of the atom. 

      Example:
         ; Define a node
         guile> (define x (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "def"))
         guile> (cog-tv x)
         (stv 0 0)
         guile> (cog-set-tv! x (cog-new-stv 0.9 0.8))
         (ConceptNode "def" (stv 0.9 0.8))
         guile> (cog-tv x)
         (stv 0.9 0.8)

=== cog-tv->alist ===
      Convert a truth value to an association list (alist).

      Example:
         guile> (define x (cog-new-stv 0.7 0.9))

      Unlike atoms, attention values are ephemeral: they are automatically
      garbage-collected when no longer needed.

      Example:
          ; Create a new attention value:
          guile> (cog-new-av 10 20 0)


=== cog-av? exp ===
      Return #t if exp is an attention value, else return #f

      Example:

         ; Define a node
         guile> (define n (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
         ; Define a version handle holding that node
         guile> (cog-new-vh "HYPOTHETICAL" n)

=== cog-vh? exp ===
      Return #t if exp is a version handle, else return #f

      Example:
         ; Define a node
         guile> (define n (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
         ; Define a version handle holding that node
         guile> (define x (cog-new-vh "HYPOTHETICAL" n))
         guile> (define y (+ 2 2))
         guile> (cog-vh? x)
         #t
         guile> (cog-tv? y)
         #f

=== cog-vh->alist ===
      Convert a version handle to an association list (alist).
      This allows scheme code to access the two parts of the 
      version handle by name, the two parts being the handle 
      and the version indicator.

      Example:
         ; Define a node
         guile> (define n (cog-new-node 'ConceptNode "abc"))
         ; Define a version handle holding that node
         guile> (define x (cog-new-vh "HYPOTHETICAL" n))
         guile> (cog-vh->alist x)
         ((indicator . HYPOTHETICAL) (atom . (ConceptNode "abc")))

=== cog-get-types ===
      Return a list of all of the atom types in the system.

      Example:
          guile> (cog-get-types)

=== cog-type? ===
      Return #t if the symbol names an atom type, else return #f

      Example:
          guile> (cog-type? 'ConceptNode)
          #t
          guile> (cog-type? 'FlorgleBarf)
          #f

=== cog-get-subtypes type ===
      Return a list of the subtypes of the given type.  Only the 
      immediate subtypes are returned; to obtain all subtypes, this
      function should be called recursively.

      Example:
          guile> (cog-get-subtypes 'Atom)
          (Link Node)

=== cog-subtype? type subtype ===
      Return #t if 'subtype' is a subtype of 'type', else return #f.
      The check is performed recursively.

      Example:
          guile> (cog-subtype? 'Node 'Link)
          #f
          guile> (cog-subtype? 'Atom 'Link)
          #t
          guile> (cog-subtype? 'Atom 'ConceptNode)
          #t

=== cog-map-type proc type ===
      Call proceedure proc for each atom in the atomspace that is of 
      type type. If proc returns any value other than #f, then the 
      iteration is terminated.  Note that this iterates only over the
      given type, and not its sub-types. Thus (cog-map-type proc 'Atom)
      will never call proc, because no atoms in the atomspace can have
      the type Atom: they are all subtypes of Atom.

      Example:
         ; define a function that prints the atoms:
         guile> (define (prt-atom h) (display h) #f)
         guile> (cog-map-type prt-atom 'ConceptNode)

=== Ad Hoc commands ===
      There are a number of scheme primitive functions defined which
      call into C++ code in assorted opencog modules. The C++ programmer
      may define such primitive by using the "define_scheme_primitive"
      function in "opencog/guile/SchemePrimitive.h".  

      Currently-implemented primtives are:
      do-wsd                -- run word-sense disambiguation
      cog-bind handle       -- run pattern matcher on handle.
                               handle must be a BindLink.
      cog-bind-crisp handle -- run pattern matcher on handle.
                               handle must be a BindLink.
                               Use crisp logic during implication.
      store-atom handle     -- store indicated atom to SQL/persistent 
                               storage.
      fetch-atom handle     -- fetch indicated atom from SQL/persistent 
                               storage.
      fetch-incoming-set    -- fetch the incoming set of the atom from 
                               SQL storage. The fetch is recursive.
      pln-bc                -- perform PLN back-chaining.


= Flow control =
The implementation uses a simple exception mechanism to allow scheme
code to return to the opencog server from anywhere. To use this, simply
throw 'cog-yield from anywhere.  The catch handler will promptly return
to the cogserver.  This can be used with continuations to implement 
some simple multi-threading.

      Example:
         guile> (throw 'cog-yield "hello world")
         (hello world)


=Notes, examples, utilities=
Various related notes.

=== Load scheme data from a file ===
There are two ways to load scheme from a file: automatically, at server
startup, or manually.

To load automatically, edit ''[[opencog.conf]]'', and append the
filename to the line ''SCM_PRELOAD'', for example:

   SCM_PRELOAD = atomspace/core_type.scm, scm/utilities.scm

The [[cogserver]] is then started with the -c flag:

   cogserver -c ../lib/opencog.conf

To manually load scheme code, simply make sure the first 3 characters
of the file are "scm" followed by a carraige return. Then, at the shell 
prompt, simply execute the command: 
 
   cat filename | telnet localhost 17001 
 
This assumes the scheme code is in "filename", that the cogserver is 
running on "localhost", and is listening on port 17001 (which is the 
default port for the cogserver).

=== Utilities ===
A number of handy utilities can be found in
<tt>opencog/scm/utilities.scm</tt> as well as [[NLP]]-specific utilities
in <tt>opencog/nlp/scm/nlp-utils.scm</tt>.  These include small, simple
routines for following a link from one atom type to another, finding all
[[EvaluationLink]]s having some given form, filtering lists based on
atom types, and so on.

====Delete a list of atoms ====
Below is a simple example of scheme code for deleting all of the atoms
in a list.

  (define (killall lst) 
     (if (null? lst) 
         '() 
         (cons (cog-delete (car lst)) 
               (killall (cdr lst)))))


===Count the total number of atoms in the atomspace===
Here is a simple example showing how to count the total number of atoms
in the atomspace.

   (define (cnt-all)
      (define cnt 0)
      (define (ink a) (set! cnt (+ cnt 1)) #f)
      (define (cnt-type x) (cog-map-type ink x))
      (map cnt-type (cog-get-types))
      cnt
   )


=== Calling scheme from C++ ===
Scheme code can be called from C++. The most common case is handled
below: calling a scheme function which expects 0,1,2 or more
<tt>Handle</tt> arguments, and returns a <tt>Handle</tt>. So, for
example, assume you have a scheme function called <tt>do-stuff</tt> as
below:

  (define (do-stuff handle1 handle2) (... return some-hand ...))

Then you can call it from C++ as follows:

  // Create a LIST_LINK on stack, holding the input arguments.
  Handle arg1 = ...;
  Handle arg2 = ...;
  hlnk = getAtomSpace.addLink(LIST_LINK, arg1, arg2, ...);
  
  // Call the "do-stuff" function
  SchemeEval evaluator;
  Handle answer = evaluator.apply("do-stuff", hlnk);

If <tt>do-stuff</tt> doesn't take any arguments, then set <tt>hlink</tt>
to <tt>Handle::UNDEFINED</tt>, or pass an empty [[ListLink]].

The above form is used by the [[ExecutionLink]] to embed scheme callouts
into hypergraphs.

=== Calling C++ from scheme ===
The C++ programmer may define new scheme primitive functions by using 
the "define_scheme_primitive" function in "opencog/guile/SchemePrimitive.h".  
This function expects a string that will be the scheme name, a C++ method,
and a pointer to a C++ object instance.  Unusual C++ signatures may require
extending SchemePrimitive.h, but this should not be hard.

The example program PrimitiveExample.cc shows how.

===Calling scheme from Hypergraphs===
The [[ExecutionLink]], whem used with the [[GroundedSchemaNode]], allows
scheme code to be invoked when the given ExecutionLink is evaluated.
See that page for details.

===Multi-threading===
Guile is multi-threading-capable, and can be used with multiple threads
just fine, with just a few caveats: it must be initialized in *each*
thread in which it is to be used. The method SchemeEval::thread_init()
initializes guile only in the *current* thread: therefore, one must 
call this method in every thread in which scheme is meant to be used.
Note that OpenCog has a way of creating threads unexpectedly, in
particular, in the server socket connection handling. Caveat Emptor.


ToDo
----
-- support readline/editline (uparrows, etc.) on input.
   Note, however, 'rlwrap telnet localhost 17001' does the trick...

-- change cog-delete to also accept a list of atoms 
-- change cog-delete to return null, not #t (?why?)
-- add ability to create CompositeTruthValue

-- It would be nice to be able to use continuations; however, the
   scm_with_guile() call has a continuation barrier in it.  I beleive
   that this continuation barrier is far too pessimistic -- it can 
   make some fairly simple checks on the C stack in order to avoid
   data corruption. However, guile needs to be fixed to change this 
   behaviour.
