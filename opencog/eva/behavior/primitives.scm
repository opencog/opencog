;; during behavior script execution.  They also depend on the config

; change-template - utility to create timeout predicates.
;
; Define a predicate that evaluates to true or false, if it is time
; to do something. PRED-NAME is the name given to the predicate,
; TS-NAME is the name given to the timestamp that holds the start-time;
; MIN-NAME and MAX-NAME are the string names of the configurable
; min and max bounds for the time interval.  So, if the elapsed time
; since the timestamp is less than MIN, then return false; if the
; elapsed time is greater than MAX then return true; else return a
; with increasing random liklihood.
;
; To compute the likelihood correctly, we have to compute the
; integral since the last time that this check was made. Thus,
; if we are calling this predicate 10 times a second, the probability
; of a transition will be failry small; but if we call it once a second,
; the probability will be ten times greater... computing even this
; simple integral in atomese is painful. Yuck. But we have to do it.
