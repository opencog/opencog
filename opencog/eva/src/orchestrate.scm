; Action orchestrator, mini version - expression multiplexer.
;
; This implements an extremely simple, no-frills action orchestrator
; for facial expressions and gestures.  It acts as a "multiplexer":
; allows different subsystems to ask for different expressions to be
; displayed, but, in the end, only allowing one or two of these to
; get through at any given time.
;
; The idea is that one subsystem may want to make the robot smile;
; another might want to make the robot frown; it cannot smile and
; frown at the same time, so only one expression should be displayed.
; The other expression can be either delayed, or completely ignored
; (rejected).  It is the code here, the "action orchestrator", that
; maintains this control and sequencing.
;
; An example: the language-processing code might get a command:
; "please smile for me", while the behavior tree might be issuing
; a frown expression. (Not clear which should have precedence).
