                     Eva Chatbot
                     -----------

Prototype that attaches the chatbot to the behavior psi-rules that
control the Hanson Robotics Eva robot emulator.

The Eva simulator emulates an animated human head, able to see,
listen and respond.

Goals
-----
Functional goals for this chatbot are:

 * Respond to verbal commands, such as "Turn left" or "Don't
   look at me." (she's always looking at you)

 * Answer queries about internal state, such as "Can you see me?"
   "Did you just smile?"

 * Remember things.  e.g. "My name is X"

 * Conduct a reasonably pleasant conversation.

Design goals for this chatbot are:

 * Understand how to convert English sentences into grounded actions.
   This should be done in some flexible way, by making use of high-level
   syntactic analysis.

 * Understand how synonymous phrases can be wired in, so that a
   fairly large set of common expressions can be understood, without
   having to hard-code each of these, manually.

 * Understand how to perform fuzzy matching, so that at least some
   basic sense can be picked out of larger, complicated sentences
   that are not themselves fully understood.

 * Understood how to implement learning, so that actions and responses
   are refined, as the robot proceeds.  Understand how refinement works.


Status
------
This is very highly experimental.  Its probably true that most design
decisions made here are not appropriate, and miss the mark.  There's
also a bunch of scaffolding, that is meant to be replaced.  Large parts
may, or may not be redesigned in the (near-term?) future.

A detailed description of the current architecture is given in the
`architecture` directory.


HOWTO
-----
There are two ways to run this thing: embodied, and disembodied.
The disembodied setup is simpler.

## Disembodied HOWTO
This version does not require the full robotics pipeline (which
includes 3D visualization via blender): it can be run in IRC, or
even at the guile prompt.  This version just prints (in English)
the actions that the robot would perform.  A webcam is recommended,
so that she can see you.

 * Build and install both the atomspace, and opencog. Ask for help
   if you don't know how to do this.
 * Start the RelEx server on port 4444 (`git clone` relex, build it,
   and run `./opencog-server.sh` in the relex main directory.)
 * (needed only for IRC) Start the cogita IRC bridge, in the
   nlp/irc directoy -- the `opencog/nlp/irc/cogita` binary.
 * Start a guile shell: just say `guile` in this directory.
 * Enter `(load "run-chatbot.scm")` at the guile prompt.
 * Talk to her via IRC.  Alternately, from the guile prompt, you
   can say: `(grounded-talk "Adam" "Look happy!")`


## Embodied HOWTO
There is a fair amount of setup needed to run the fully-embodied
version.

 * The animation is done in blender; you have to install blender
   and get the blender rig.

 * Communications is done using ROS. You have to install ROS and
   catkin and catkin make to build the ROS messages.

 * The bridge between opencog and ROS is in the
   https://github.com/opencog/ros-behavior-scripting
   repo. Download and run that.

See the directory https://github.com/opencog/ros-behavior-scripting
for additional information.  It will give pointers as to how to
install and configure the above pieces.


General sketch
--------------
The discussion here assumes familiarity with the simpler "generic"
chatbot pipeline, in the `nlp/chatbot` directory.  You should study
that first; otherwise the discussion here will seem disconnected and
incomplete.

The general technical intent here is to somehow associate nouns and
verbs with grounded objects and actions. At the most basic level, this
is relatively "easy": a single word, verb or noun, is associated with a
single action or item. The first serious challenge comes with modifiers:
adjectives and adverbs.

Several aproaches are possible. We (currently) reject the simplest and
easiest one, which is to use simple string-matching to extract verbs
and actions from strings of words (sentences).  Although this can be
a very effective way to cobble together a clever-seeming chatbot, it
does not give insight into the general problem of learning and
intelligence. Thus, its avoided here, and a more complex path is taken.

The more complex path passes all language through a parser, to extract
syntactic information from the sentence; the pattern matching is then
performed at the syntactic level.  language has structure for a reason,
and one ignores that structure at one's own peril.

The question then becomes: how to ground complex structure? The answer
that I propose here is use a set of refinements of understanding: what,
in topology, is called a "filter".  Ideally, an utterance should be
understood very precisely: every word in the sentence counts, every
syntactic relation has an effect, every tense, mood and number plays a
role in the understanding of that sentence.  In practice, the robot is
stupid, and will be continually encountering sentences that it only
partly understands.  Thus, the concept of a "filter": the filter is a
collection of increasingly less-precise understandings of an utterance.
All of these "understandings" enclose or wrap or encompass the "true"
meaning of the utterance; just that some understandings are less precise
than others.  The task is to find the most precise understanding
possible.

For example: given an utterance, perhaps there is some rule that
identifies a single word in that sentence: that rule associates a
grounded meaning to that word.  Perhaps there is another rule that can
identify two words in the sentence, and can simultaneously ground both
in a single coherent context for action.  This second rule is then more
precise than the first.  Whatever meaning there is, whatever action is
to be taken, it is to be taken under the control of the second rule.
Unless there is a third rule that is more precise than the second, in
which case the third rule applies. The "filter" here is simply a chain
of possible interpretations of an utterance, ordered from least to
most precise.

If a precise interpretation of a sentence cannot be found, then the
sentence should be factored into parts, and those parts be combined as
best as possible.  If one rule recognizes one word, a verb in the
utterance, and another rule recognizes one word, a noun, but there are
no rules that recognize two words, then one does as best as one can:
the sentence is "factored" into parts.  A learning (guessing) subsystem
does its best to combine the parts into a more precise whole: the more
parts, the narrower and more refined the understanding.  XXX TODO
but how does this combination actually work?

The goal of thinking in terms of filters is to think in terms of
"fallback plans" -- if there is no narrow understanding of an utterance,
we fall back to some other, more vague understanding, picking the most
precise one possible, and somehow combining it with any other partial
understanding from other rules that recognize parts of a sentence.


Context
-------
Rules should be applied only in relation to the current context.  This
is for two reasons: one is performance: if we know that a rule is not
applicable in a certain context, then we don't waste CPU time in
applying it.  A second reason is that rules can simplify, or factor,
by not requiring a context to be a part of its specification.  Its not
clear that the URE can currently handle contexts in this sense. At this
time, contextualized knowledge seems to be a slightly lower priority.


Imperative Architecture
-----------------------
The current architecture for handling imperative sentences is in
`imperative.scm`.  An alternative (failed, incomplete, better)
architecture is sketched in `imperative-alt.scm`.

At the center of the architecture is the ActionLink. Its a new,
experimental link type used for holding simplified representations
of imperatives, intermediate in form from the fully-parsed English
language input, and the low-level physical motor commands.  That
is, parsed English is converted into these simplified action structures,
and then these simplified structures are mapped to actual physical
actions.

The ActionLink has (for example) the following format:

    ActionLink
       WordNode "some verb"        ;;; a proto-SchemaNode
       ListLink
          ConceptNode "slot value"   ;;; or a WordNode

This is a kind-of flattened or simplified representation of a sentence.
The "slot value" here is maybe the object of the verb, maybe a
prepositional adjective, verb modifier, etc. The precise linguistic
category is not central to this simplified representation.

Some rule will take an input imperative sentence, and boil it down to
this simplified form.   Another rule will then search for a grounding
for this.  Groundings are of the form:

    ReferenceLink
       ActionLink
          SchemaNode "some verb"   ;;; SchemaNode, or WordNode
          ListLink
             ConceptNode "slot value"   ;;; or a WordNode
       ExecutionOutputLink
          GroundedPredicateNode "py: some_action"
          ListLink
             ConceptNode "argument 1"
             NumberNode  42

The grounding associates the simplified schema with an explicit
mechanical/physical action to be taken.  It is currently implemented
as a one-to-one map.

Future possible enhancement: A given simplified sentence may suggest
multiple different actions to be taken.  Which, if any of these should
be taken?  A given input sentence may suggests multiple different
simplified sentences, and each simplified sentences is suggesting
multiple different actions. This forms a network.  This network would
need to be a weighted network, so that, of the large choice of different
actions, only a few might be selected as the "most likely" and
performed.

Out of this set of possible actions, some may be contradictory; these
need to be sorted into subsets that are self-consistent with each other.
I guess this is a glimmer of an action orchestrater.


Action Orchestrator
-------------------
Although the above example shows a python call "py: some_action",
the actual action passes through the "action orchestrator", before
getting to the robot.  The action orchestrator acts as a multiplexer,
combining actions from multiple sources, and not just the chatbot.
That is, other behavior trees and OpenPsi controllers may also be
vying to express some action; the action orchestrator resolves these.

The action orchestrator is implenented in the `eva/behavior` directory,
and is loaded as a scheme module `(use-modules (opencog eva-behavior))`


Environment Awarenes and Self Awareness
---------------------------------------
The `(use-modules (opencog eva-behavior))` contains rudiemntary models
of the immediate environment (visible human faces) and a model of self
(maintained after the action orchestroator has resolved any conflicts).

Code to allow question-answering against this grounded knowledge is in
development.


Current defacto implementation
------------------------------
Here is how the code is currently organized. It may or may not match
what other parts of this readme file say.

* imperative.scm -- end-to-end pipeline, converting sentence to action.
* imperative-rules.scm -- rules to convert English sentences to an
      intermediate form.
* semantics.scm -- rules to compare the intermediate form to the
      knowledgebase of grounded knowledge.
* knowledge.scm -- ontology of grounded knowledge.

* self-model.scm -- atomspace model of the robot-self.
* model-query.scm -- querying of self-knowledge (self-awareness)


Understanding synonymous phrases
--------------------------------
Need to add support for synonyms and synonymous phrases -- e.g. "make a
happy expression" (which the chatbot currently does not understand) is
synonymous to "show happiness" (which the chatbot does understand).

Also -- right now "show happiness" and "express happiness" are both
hard-coded; we would like to have "demonstrate" as a synonym for
either of these.

Currently, there are a larg number of synonymous verbs and adjectives
hard-coded in `knowledge.scm`. These should be replaced by a proper
synonymous-phrase system.


Eloquent self-expression (with synonymous phrases)
--------------------------------------------------
Currently, any self-awareness queries get rather stiff replies.
For example, the gaze-direction self-model has "leftwards", "rightwards"
as possible gaze directions. When asked where she is looking, she
responds with these self-model words directly.  It would be much
better if she responded with some synonymous phrase, such as "to the
left".  Such a choice of wording is part of personality, so the choice
of synonymous phrases would need to be controlled by some personality
module.


Lack of lexical functions
-------------------------
Although the current sureal does a good job of assembling sentences,
it completely lacks support for "lexicial functions":  there is no
mechanism to convert infinitives into the proper tense; to take a
noun and adjust the noun-number as needed, etc.  In other words, the
input into sureal already has to have the correct tense, noun-number,
etc. already specified. This severely limits expressiveness, and makes
it difficult to formulate a good reply.  (XXX This is being fixed by
Man Hin right now).


Modifiers
---------
Need to implement modifiers: e.g. "turn a little bit to the left"
"turn a little bit more", "turn a little bit less", "a little more".
Not at all clear how to accomplish this.


Face awareness
--------------
TODO: implement environment awareness: "look at me", "look at him".

TODO: she does not recognize he own name.

TODO: she does not know the names of people.


Issues
------
Linguistic issues abound.  Consider these sentences: "She looks good",
"She looks left".  Both have essentially the same syntactic parse, but
have very different semantics: the first should generate the dependency
relation _to-be(look, good) while the second should generate the active
_to-do(look, left). We cannot distinguish these from the syntax alone.
What should we do?  The only answer I can think of is to learn by
mutating rules ...

Generalizations: for example, look-rule-1 explicitly looks for the verb
"look". This needs to be replaced by some word-sense disambiguation WSD
stage, so that any synonym of "look" is sufficient.  Even more: any
synonymous command should be enough, not just on the word level, but
generally.

"Keep smiling" needs to relaunch the smile animation every second or
so, because it fades away.  Thus, we need some temporal thread to keep
this going.


Bugs
----
Sometimes, imperatives get mis-classified as Declaratives. It seems
random and intermittent and non-reproducible. Not sure what the issue
is.  e.g. "Eva, turn to the right" "Eva, look up" "Eva, look up"
after a few of these, on gets marked as declarative.

What works, currently
---------------------
Below are examples of sentences that Eva is currently able to
understand and respond to.  Enter these at the IRC chatbot interface,
alternately, say this at the guile prompt:

   (grounded-talk "nick" "Look up!")

where "nick" is your chat nick, and "Look up!" is a typical sentence.

Imperatives:

   Eva, look to the right.
   Look up!
   Eva, turn to the right.
   turn left
   Look down.
   look straight ahead
   turn forward

("looking" makes here move her eyes only; turning turns he whole head).

   Smile!
   frown
   Look sad
   Look happy
   Look surprised
   Look bored
   Eva, express boredom
   Eva, show happiness!
	Feign amusement
   Dramatize loathing
	Portray puzzlement
	Shake your head
	Blink!
	Yawn!

The blender model contains a dozen emotion-expression animations, such
as fear, disgust, boredom, smiling, surprise and a half-dozen gestures,
including nodding, blinking and yawning.  Assorted synonmyous verbs and
adjectives should trigger these.

Self-awareness questions (under construction)

   Where are you looking?   XXX this got broken, and the fix is hard.
      The correct fix is to wire up to the space server.
   What are you doing?
   What did you just do?
   What happened just now?


Some mappings:
--------------
where are you looking? -> where-look-rule
waht are you doing? -> what-doing-rule

Idealized replies:
------------------
What are you doing?
+ I am looking at you
+ I am looking to the left
+ I am smiling
+ (makes a face) I am frowning.


===========================
TODO

ActionLink could be/should be renamed ExecutionLink

... and have Inheritance to identify it as a kind of action.


OpenPsi:
    ImplicationLink
        SequentialAndLink
            Predicate - Is there a new verbal command?
            ExecuteOutputLink
                Obey the command
        Goal- "Obey user"

* Replace rules with psi-rules (or with forward chainer)

* Provide simple string-matching API.
