; Model of Eva's current physical state, represented in the Atomspace.
;
; This attempts to maintain a model, in the atomspace, of what the robot
; is actually doing, from moment to moment.  This model is important for
; multiple reasons:
;
; -- It is needed for Action Orchestration, to make sure that multiple
;    conflicting command sources do not cause the robot to do incoherent
;    things (such as smile and frown at the same time, or move lips
;    without talking, etc.)
;
; -- It is needed for self-awareness, so that the chatbot can respond to
;    questions about what Eva is doing.
;
; Example usage:
;; Load the needed modules.
; (use-modules (opencog) (opencog query) (opencog exec))
; (use-modules (opencog atom-types) (opencog movement))
; (use-modules (opencog eva-model))
;
;; If actually driving the pysical robot, then ...
;; start roscore first, then the movement bridge:
; (start-ros-movement-node)
;
; Examples and debugging hints:
; Some (but not all) state queries:
; (cog-evaluate! (DefinedPredicate "chatbot is talking?"))
; (cog-evaluate! (DefinedPredicate "chatbot is listening?"))
