                      Dotty Graphs
                      ------------

This is a dotty module, it makes a BIG dotty graph containing every node and 
link in the AtomSpace.

Nodes are represented as ellipses.
Links are represented as diamonds.

By default, only outgoing connections between atoms are shown.  The flag 
'with-incoming' can be specified to the dotty command to enable the display 
of incoming connections, which will be represented as dotted lines.  
(I've never found this useful).

Example of use:

telnet localhost 17001
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain.
Escape character is '^]'.
opencog> loadmodule libdotty.so
ok

opencog> dotty
[...]

Or perhaps more useful:

$ echo 'loadmodule libdotty.so' | nc -w 1 localhost 17001
$ echo 'dotty' | nc -w 1 localhost 17001 | tail -n +2 > /tmp/opencog.dot
$ dotty /tmp/opencog.dot

Enjoy.
