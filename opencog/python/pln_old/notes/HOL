Different forms of EvaluationLink:

Evaluation P cat
Implication P Q
=====
Evaluation Q cat

That form is handled by E2I, Deduction and then I2E.
Maybe even have a macro rule for all that!

E2I Inheritance {cat} SatSet(P)

Implication P Q = Inheritance SatSet(P) SatSet(Q)
=>
Inheritance {cat} SatSet(Q)

I2M
Evaluation Q cat


The ImplicationLinks and InheritanceLinks should just be considered equivalent (or something?)




Similarity Substitution (do we want to have it?). It's a lot less natural probably (but so useful!)
Similarity substitution only works if you calculate sets differently.

cats eat mice
mice are mammals
cats eat mammals

Evaluation eat cats mice
Inheritance mice mammals
===Evaluation eat cats mammals

GeneralEvaluationToMemberRule
EvaluationLink (eats cat _) mice
MemberLink mice SatSet(eats cat _)
InheritanceLink mice SatSet(eats cat _)


AbductionRule:
InheritanceLink mice SatSet(eats cat _)
InheritanceLink mice mammals

InheritanceLink SatSet(eats cat _) mammals

I2M:
Member mammals SatSet(eats cat _)
=EvaluationLink eats cat mammals



The precise way to do the probabilistic bit in the middle depends on which conversion you use. It seems like something currying-ish is useful though?
