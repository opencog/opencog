# Rule outputs an AverageLink that already exists, it must have the

# All variables MUST have an explicit scope, which makes things way

# Then we want to modify DeductionRule and other Rules so they support
# AverageLinks appropriately.

# A possible way to do it would be to make a class that modifies
# first-order PLN rules so that they will use blah blah.
# Possible inputs:
# InheritanceLink ConceptNode:A ConceptNode:B, A.tv (first order)
# ImplicationLink PredicateNode:A PredicateNode:B, A.tv
# (higher order, but trivial)

# AverageLink $x: ImplicationLink F($x) G($x)
# requires AverageLink $x: F($x)
# Or with DeductionRule:
# AverageLink $x: ImplicationLink F($x) H($x)
# requires AverageLink $x: ImplicationLink F($x) G($x)
# requires AverageLink $x: ImplicationLink G($x) H($x)
# requires AverageLink $x: F($x)
# (etc for G and H)
# Note that the variable used at the top scope must be used everywhere.


# You also need to be able to calculate AndLinks across expressions
# with variables in them. Same idea

# Basically, assume that an expression is quantified with an
# AverageLink and those variables must appear below (but what if they
# don't?!)

# e.g.
# AverageLink $x: AndLink ($x is a Norse god) (Norse gods exist)
# If a sub-expression doesn't contain the variable, you should just use
# its TruthValue. If it does contain the variable, you have to add an
# AverageLink into it. The sub-expressions may use the same or
# different names for a variable though. It might be easier not to use
# AverageLinks explicitly (although I guess you always have to check


# The TruthValue for AverageLink $x: EvaluationLink F($x)
# may be different to the TV for the SatisfyingSet of F($x) because it
# is the average fuzzy TruthValue

# There should probably be a special class that modifies existing rules
# to use variables. (It doesn't depend on which rule you use, i think)


# The variable can also be in different places, and you have to check
# that it's in the expression, and blah blah. It seems annoying to do
# this right I probably need a custom_compute (and maybe more)?
# Forward chaining may be slightly easier


# you need to know the probability for $a. maybe use the default term
# probability?

You can do something similar for other expressions too. It's really
cool and possibly even useful! (For making inference less annoying
by removing variables!)

converting it into opencog-ish concepts would make inference easier
(maybe?) (if support for variables is broken somehow)
it would mean you could do deduction and induction and calculating
similarity links more easily.

except there's not enough properties info to direct-evaluate
interesting similarity links, probably
