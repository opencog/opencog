- spatial_rules.scm : Atoms describing rules that define the interaction of 
    different avators and humanoids with regards to the spatial components.
- spatial_information.scm : Atoms describing the 3D World in which interactions
    are made as well as the set of avators and humanoids interacting.
- deception.scm : Atoms describing rules characterising the behavoirs of the
    avator and humanoid independent of interaction with the environment.

Note that we don't have different instances of OpenCog controlling the Avatar(Bob) and
Humanoid the definition of state includes. Maybe on the next iteration :-)
