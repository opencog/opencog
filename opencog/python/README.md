## Web API ##
The Web API provides a REST interface to the AtomSpace. Unfortunately,
it is not maintained, and assumes an older structure.  In particular,
it does not support Values in general, and assumes that all atoms have
a TruthValue (they don't, in general) and have an Attention value
(they don't when they are not in the attention bank).  This needs to be
fixed. Volunteers needed. See:
