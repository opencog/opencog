                  -------------------

This directory contains core OpenCog code.  Tests, example and demo 
programs have their own directories.

Source code overview:

atomspace       -- Defines atoms, nodes, links, truth values, etc. 
                   Everything else depends on this.

persist         -- Methods for communcation between servers, also,
                   saving/restoring the atomspace to disk, database, etc.

query           -- Pattern matching, evaluation for the atomspace.

guile, scm      -- Scheme language bindings.
python,cython   -- Python langauge bindings.  
shell           -- Command-line shell interface.

server          -- CogServer main server.
benchmark       -- Performance benchmarks.

nlp             -- English language processing
reasoning       -- Backward-chainers

dynamics        -- Attention allocation.
spatial, spacetime -- Space and time matrix for avatars.
embodiment      -- Avatars

comboreduct     -- Combo language, term-rewriting system.
learning        -- Supervised program learning, including MOSES

visualization   -- Visualization, graphics.

cycl-import     -- Import OpenCyc datasets

@todo Create doxygen filter to parse scm files.
