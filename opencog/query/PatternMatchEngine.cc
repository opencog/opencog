/**
 * Pattern Match Engine Overview
 * -----------------------------
 *
 * The pattern match engine finds groundings (interpretations) for a
 * set of mandatory and optional clauses. It can be thought of in seveal
 * ways: it performs a variable unification across multiple clauses;
 * it discovers groundings for variables; it solves the subgraph
 * isomorphism problem; it queries a graphical relational database
 * for data that satisfies the query statement; it solves a typed
 * satisfiability problem; it finds an "answer set".  Which of these
 * things it does depends on your point of view; it does all of these
 * things, although, in each case, the langauge is slightly different.
 *
 * It works by being given a list ov variables ("bound variables") and
 * a set of mandatory and optional clauses containing those variables.
 * Each "clause" is nothing more than an ordinary OpenCog Atom:
 * specifically, a typed link.  It should be thought of as a tree, the
 * tree being formed by the outgoing set of the Atom.  We could call
 * these things "Atoms" or "Links", but it is more convenient to call
 * them "clauses", in part to avoid confusion, and in part because they
 * resemble terms (from "term algebra") or the "sentences" (of
 * first-order logic). They, in fact, are neither, but there is a
 * general resemblance that is useful to keep in mind.
 *
 * Any given clause is "solved" or "grounded", if there exists a
 * substitution for the variables such that the resulting clause exists
 * in the atomspace.  Thus, a grounding can be thought of as an
 * "interpretation" of the clause; the pattern matcher searches for
 * interpretations.  It can be thought of as a "unifier", in that ALL
 * of the mandatory clauses must be grounded, and they must grounded in
 * a self-consistent way (i.e. the clauses must be grounded in
 * conjunction with one-another.)
 *
 * The list of "bound vars" are to be solved for ("grounded", or
 * "interpreted") during pattern matching. That is, if the subgraph
 * defined by the clauses is located, then the vars are given the
 * corresponding values associated to that match. Because these
 * variables can be shared across multiple clauses, this can be
 * understood to be a unification problem; the pattern matcher is thus
 * a unifier.
 *
 * The optionals are a set of clauses which are also searched for,
 * but whose presence is not mandatory. The optional clauses can be
 * used to implement negation or pattern-rejection (among other things).
 * Thier use for negation/rejection is determined by the "optional
 * clause" callback.  Thus, if an optional clause is found, the callback
 * can then signal that the pattern as a whole should be rejected.
 * Alternately, the callback could base its considerations on the
 * truth-value of the optionall clause: if the optional clause has
 * a TV of FALSE, then it is accepted; otherwise it is rejected.
 * Other strategies for handling optional clauses in the callback
 * are also possible. Thus, optional clauses themselves can be thought
 * as implementing a bridge between "intuitionistic logic" and
 * "classical logic", depending on ow they are handled in the callback.
 *
 * At every step of the process, the PatternMatchCallback is consulted
 * to determine whether a candidate match should be accepted or not.
 * In general, the callbacks have almost total control over the search;
 * the pattern match engine only provides the general framework for
 * navigating and backtracking and maintaining the needed state for
 * such traversal.  It is up to the callbacks to perform the actual
 * grounding or interpreation, and to record the search results.

/**
 * tree_compare compares two trees, side-by-side.
 *
 * Compare two incidence trees, side-by-side.  The incidence tree is
 * given by following the "outgoing set" of the links appearing in the
 * tree.  The incidence tree is the so-called "Levi graph" of the
 * hypergraph.  The first arg should be a handle to a clause in the
 * pattern, while the second arg is a handle to a candidate grounding.
 * The pattern (predicate) clause is compared to the candidate grounding,
 * returning true if there is a mis-match.
 *
 * The comparison is recursive, so this method calls itself on each
 * subtree of the predicate clause, performing comparisons until a
 * match is found (or not found).
 *
 * Return false if there's a mis-match. The goal here is to walk over
 * the entire tree, without mismatches.  Since a return value of false
 * stops the iteration, false is used to signal a mismatch.
 *
 * The pattern clause may contain quotes (QuoteLinks), which signify
 * that what follows must be treated as a literal (constant), rather
 * than being interpreted.  Thus, quotes can be used to search for
 * expressions containing variables (since a quoted variable is no
 * longer a variable, but a constant).  Quotes can also be used to
 * search for GroundedPredicateNodes (since a quoted GPN will be
 * treated as a constant, and not as a function).  Quotes can be nested,
 * only the first quote is used to escape into the literal context,
 * and so quotes can be used to search for expressions containing
 * quotes.  It is assumed that the QuoteLink has an arity of one, as
 * its quite unclear what an arity of more than one could ever mean.
 *
 * That method have side effects. The main one is to insert variable
 * groundings (and in fact sub-clauses grounding as well) in
 * var_grounding when encountering variables (and sub-clauses) in the
 * pattern.
