/**
 * Fitness function for maximizing binary precision, that is, for
 * minimizing false positives.   This scorer works for both boolean
 * regression and contin regression.  For contin regression, the
 * learned combo program still returns a boolean T/F, which is then
 * used to sum the values of the contin output value.  That is, if
 * the combo returns T for a given row, then we add the contin value
 * in that row.  If the combo returns false for that row, we do nothing.
 *
 * For contin tables, if 'positive' is false, then the negative of
 * the contin value is used for all calculations.
 *
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification
 *
 * This bscore has 2 components:
 *
 * 1) The precision.  That is, the number of true positives divided
 *    by the sum of true and false positives.  If the paramter 'positive'
 *    is set to false, then the 'negative predictive value' is computed
 *    (i.e. maximing the true negatives, minimizing false negatives).
 *
 * 2) a penalty ensuring that at least some true positives are found,
 *    as otherwise one can get perfect precision by always answering
 *    false (and thus there would be zero false poitives).  The penalty
 *    is explained below.
 *
 * The scorer counts the total number of rows for which the combo program
 * returned 'true'. This is defined as the 'activation'.  For boolean tables,
 * the activation is just the number of true positives plus the number of 
 * false positives.  
 *
 * Note that an activation of zero corresponds to perfect precision:
 * there were no false positives.  Thus, to get reasonable results,
 * one wants to learn a function that predicts at least a few true
 * postives, i.e. has an activation greater than zero.  This is done
 * by applying a penalty when the activation is outside of the range
 * of an interval [min_activation, max_activation].  See the
 * description of discriminating_bscore::get_threshold_penalty() for
 * details.
 *
 * If worst_norm is true, then the percision is divided by the absolute
 * average of the negative lower (resp. positive upper if
 * this->positive is false) decile or less. If there is no negative
 * (resp. positive if this->positive is false) values then it is not
 * normalized. (??)
 *
 * If substract_neg_target is true then the negation of the target (in
 * the boolean case) count for -1/2 instead of 0 and 1/2 instead of
 * 1. In other words the fitness to maximize is:
 *
 * 1/2 * (tp - fp) / (tp + fp)
 *
 * where tp and fp stand for true positive and false positive
 * respectively. This is actually equivalent to
 *
 * 1/2 * (tp - tp + tp - fp) / (tp + fp)
 * = 1/2 * (tp + tp) / (tp + fp) - (tp + fp) / (tp + fp)
 * = 1/2 * 2*tp / (tp + fp) - 1
 * = precision - 1/2
 *
 * One might ask then why use that fitness function instead of
 * precision as they are equivalent up to an additive constant. The
 * reason is because the bscore will look differently, in such case
 * when an element of the bscore is 0 it will likely correspond to no
 * activity. Active data points contributing to a precision above half
 * will have positive values, active data points contributing to a
 * precision below half will have negative values, active data points
 * contributing to precision of exactly 0.5 will have null values
 * (like inactive points, but it's rather unlikely).
 *
 * XXX This class should be reworked to derive from
 * discriminating_bscore.  This would allow us to get rid of duplicate
 * code for sec_complexity_coef() and for get_activation_penalty() and
 * min_improv() and sum_outputs(). TODO In fact everything could be
 * replaced, if it were not for the worst_deciles stuff.

/**
 * Behavioral scoring function minimizing residual errors.
 *
 * The first elements of the bscore correspond to the minus squared
 * errors. The last element is optional and corresponds to a program
 * size penalty.
 *
 * The math justifying the program size penalty equations is based on
 * the following thread
 * http://groups.google.com/group/opencog-news/browse_thread/thread/b7704419e082c6f1
 *
 * Here's a summary:
 * Let M == model (the combo program being learned)
 * Let D == data (the table of values being modelled)
 * Let P(..) == probability
 * Let dP(..) == probability density
 *
 * According to Bayes
 *
 *    dP(M|D) = dP(D|M) * P(M) / P(D)
 *
 * Now let's consider the log likelihood of M knowing D.  Since D is
 * constant we can ignore P(D), so:
 *
 *    LL(M) = log(dP(D|M)) + log(P(M))
 *
 * Assume the output of M on input x has a Guassian noise of mean M(x)
 * and variance v, so dP(D|M) (the density probability)
 *
 *   dP(D|M) = Prod_{x\in D} (2*Pi*v)^(-1/2) exp(-(M(x)-D(x))^2/(2*v))
 *
 * Assume
 *    P(M) = |A|^-|M|
 * where |A| is the alphabet size.
 *
 * After simplification we can get the following log-likelihood of dP(M|D)
 *    -|M|*log(|A|)*2*v - Sum_{x\in D} (M(x)-D(x))^2
 *
 * Each datum corresponds to a feature of the bscore.
 *
 *    |M|*log(|A|)*2*v corresponds to an additional feature when v > 0

/**
 * ctruth_table_bscore -- compute behavioral score for boolean truth tables.
 *
 * The CTable ctt holds the "compressed" data table, consisting of
 * rows of input (independent) variables, and a single output
 * (dependent) variable. Scoring is performed by evaluating the
 * combo tree for each input row, and comparing the evaluation results
 * to the output column.
 *
 * The first elements correspond to the minus absolute errors (0 if
 * the booleans fit, -1 if they don't). The last element is optional
 * and corresponds to a program size penalty.
 *
 * Regarding the program size penalty, instead of considering a
 * standard deviation of the output, the probability p that one datum
 * is wrong is used.  Note that we expect p to be small; certainly
 * much less than 1/2 (as p=1/2 means half our data is wrong!)
 *
 * To summarize, the end result is the log-likelihood LL(M) that the
 * model M is correct:
 *
 *     LL(M) = -|M|*log(|A|) + |D_ne| log(p/(1-p)) + |D| log(1-p)
 *
 * which may be re-interpreted as a score:
 *
 *     score(M) = - [ LL(M) - |D| log(1-p) ] / log(p/(1-p))
 *              = -|D_ne| + |M|*log|A| / log(p/(1-p))
 *              = -|D_ne| - |M| |C_coef|
 *
 * where |D_ne| is the number of outputs that are incorrect, and |M| is
 * the complexity of the model, and |A| is the alphabets size employed
 * in the model.
 *
 * The coeffcient |C_coef| can be fixed in several different ways, and
 * not just relying on estimates of p and |A|. It is set by calling
 * bscore_base::set_complexity_coeff()
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 * To summarize, if any of the entries in the data table are incorrect,
 * with some probability p, this is equivalent to raising the score by
 * an amount proportional to the model complexity.
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The details were originally reported in this thread,
 * http://groups.google.com/group/opencog/browse_thread/thread/a4771ecf63d38df
 * and are restated, cleaned up, below:
 *
 * M is the model (the combo program)
 * D is the data, a table of n inputs i_k and one output o
 *     i_1 ... i_n o
 *
 * where i_k is the k'th input and o the output.  We want to assess
 * P(M|D) and, in particular, maximize it, as it is the fitness function.
 * According to Bayes
 *
 *     P(M|D) = P(D|M) * P(M) / P(D)
 *
 * Consider the log likelihood of M knowing D.  Since D is constant,
 * we can ignore P(D), so:
 *
 *     LL(M) = log(P(D|M)) + log(P(M))
 *
 * Assume each output of M on input x has probability p to be wrong.  So,
 *
 *     P(D|M) = Prod_{x\in D} [p*(M(x) != D(x)) + (1-p)*(M(x) == D(x))]
 *
 * where D(x) the observed result given input x.  Then,
 *
 *     log P(D|M) = Sum_{x\in D} log[p*(M(x) != D(x)) + (1-p)*(M(x) == D(x))]
 *
 * Let D = D_eq \cup D_ne  where D_eq and D_ne are the sets
 *
 *     D_eq = {x \in D | M(x) == D(x) }
 *     D_ne = {x \in D | M(x) != D(x) }
 *
 * Then
 *
 *     log P(D|M) = Sum_{x\in D_ne} log(p) + Sum_{x\in D_eq} log(1-p)
 *                = |D_ne| log(p) + |D_eq| log(1-p)
 *                = |D_ne| log(p) + |D| log(1-p) - |D_ne| log(1-p)
 *                = |D_ne| log(p/(1-p)) + |D| log(1-p)
 *
 * Here, |D| is simply the size of set D, etc.  Assuming that p is
 * small, i.e. much less than one, then, to second order in p:
 *
 *    log(1-p) = -p + p^2/2 + O(p^3)
 *
 * So:
 *
 *    log P(D|M) = |D_ne| log(p) - p (|D| - |D_ne|) + O(p^2)
 *
 * Next, assume P(M) is distributed according to Solomonoff's Universal
 * Distribution, approximated by (for now)
 *
 *     P(M) = |A|^-|M|
 *          = exp(-|M|*log(|A|))
 *
 * where A is the alphabet of the model, and |M| is the complexity of
 * the model.  Putting it all together, the log-likelihood of M is:
 *
 *     LL(M) = -|M|*log(|A|) + |D_ne| log(p/(1-p)) + |D| log(1-p)
 *
 * To get an expression usable for the score, just bring out the |D_ne|
 * by dividing by -log(p/(1-p)), to get
 *
 *     score(M) = - [ LL(M) - |D| log(1-p) ] / log(p/(1-p))
 *              = -|D_ne| + |M|*log|A| / log(p/(1-p))
 *              = -|D_ne| - |M| |C_coef|
 *
 * Note that, since p<1, that log(p) is negative, and so the second
 * term is negative.  It can be understood as a "complexity penalty".
