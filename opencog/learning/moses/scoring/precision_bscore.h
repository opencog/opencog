/**
 * Fitness function for maximizing binary precision, that is, for
 * minimizing false positives.   This scorer works for both boolean
 * regression and contin regression.  For contin regression, the
 * learned combo program still returns a boolean T/F, which is then
 * used to sum the values of the contin output value.  That is, if
 * the combo returns T for a given row, then we add the contin value
 * in that row.  If the combo returns false for that row, we do nothing.
 *
 * For contin tables, if 'positive' is false, then the negative of
 * the contin value is used for all calculations.
 *
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification
 *
 * This bscore has 2 components:
 *
 * 1) The precision.  That is, the number of true positives divided
 *    by the sum of true and false positives.  If the paramter 'positive'
 *    is set to false, then the 'negative predictive value' is computed
 *    (i.e. maximing the true negatives, minimizing false negatives).
 *
 * 2) a penalty ensuring that at least some true positives are found,
 *    as otherwise one can get perfect precision by always answering
 *    false (and thus there would be zero false poitives).  The penalty
 *    is explained below.
 *
 * The scorer counts the total number of rows for which the combo program
 * returned 'true'. This is defined as the 'activation'.  For boolean tables,
 * the activation is just the number of true positives plus the number of 
 * false positives.  
 *
 * Note that an activation of zero corresponds to perfect precision:
 * there were no false positives.  Thus, to get reasonable results,
 * one wants to learn a function that predicts at least a few true
 * postives, i.e. has an activation greater than zero.  This is done
 * by applying a penalty when the activation is outside of the range
 * of an interval [min_activation, max_activation].  See the
 * description of discriminating_bscore::get_threshold_penalty() for
 * details.
 *
 * If worst_norm is true, then the percision is divided by the absolute
 * average of the negative lower (resp. positive upper if
 * this->positive is false) decile or less. If there is no negative
 * (resp. positive if this->positive is false) values then it is not
 * normalized. (??)
 *
 * If substract_neg_target is true then the negation of the target (in
 * the boolean case) count for -1/2 instead of 0 and 1/2 instead of
 * 1. In other words the fitness to maximize is:
 *
 * 1/2 * (tp - fp) / (tp + fp)
 *
 * where tp and fp stand for true positive and false positive
 * respectively. This is actually equivalent to
 *
 * 1/2 * (tp - tp + tp - fp) / (tp + fp)
 * = 1/2 * (tp + tp) / (tp + fp) - (tp + fp) / (tp + fp)
 * = 1/2 * 2*tp / (tp + fp) - 1
 * = precision - 1/2
 *
 * One might ask then why use that fitness function instead of
 * precision as they are equivalent up to an additive constant. The
 * reason is because the bscore will look differently, in such case
 * when an element of the bscore is 0 it will likely correspond to no
 * activity. Active data points contributing to a precision above half
 * will have positive values, active data points contributing to a
 * precision below half will have negative values, active data points
 * contributing to precision of exactly 0.5 will have null values
 * (like inactive points, but it's rather unlikely).
 *
 * XXX This class should be reworked to derive from
 * discriminating_bscore.  This would allow us to get rid of duplicate
 * code for sec_complexity_coef() and for get_activation_penalty() and
 * min_improv() and sum_outputs(). TODO In fact everything could be
 * replaced, if it were not for the worst_deciles stuff.
