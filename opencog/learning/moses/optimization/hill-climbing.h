/**
 * Hill Climbing: search the local neighborhood of an instance for the
 * highest score, move to that spot, and repeat until no further
 * improvment is possible.
 *
 * This optimizatin algo performs an exhaustive search of the local
 * neighborhood centered upon a specific instance. The search is
 * normally limited to the neighborhood at Hamming distance=1 from the
 * central instance. The point with the best score (the "highest point")
 * is declared the new center, and the exhaustive search of the nearest
 * neighbors is repeated.  This loop is repeated until no further
 * improvement is possible.
 *
 * The number of nearest neighbors is roughly equal to the number of
 * knobs in the exemplar, and, more precisely, to the information-
 * theoretic bit length of the field set.
 *
 * The operation of this algorithm is modified in several important
 * ways. If the number of nearest neighbors exceeeds a significant
 * fraction of the max-allowed scoring function evaluations, then the
 * nearest neighborhood is sub-sampled, instead of being exhaustively
 * searched.
 *
 * If the single_step flag is set, then the search will terminate if
 * a higher-scoring instance is found.  Since the search is made only
 * to distance=1, using this flag is silly, unless the widen_search
 * flag is also used, which will cause the algo to search increasingly
 * larger neighborhoods.  In this case, the algo stops when improvement
 * is seen, or all neighborhoods up to the maximum distance have been
 * explored.
 *
 * In call cases, the neighborhood searched is 'spherical'; that is,
 * only the instances that are equi-distant from the exemplar are
 * explored (i.e. at the same Hamming distance).
 *
 * NB: most problems seem to do just fine without the single-step,
 * broaden-search flag combination.  However, some problems, esp. those
 * with a deceptive scoring function (e.g. polynomial factoring, -Hsr)
 * seem to work better with -L1 -T1 -I0.
