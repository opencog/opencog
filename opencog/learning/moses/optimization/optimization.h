/**
 * information_theoretic_bits -- return information content of the field set.
 *
 * The information content of a single variable is defined as log base
 * two of the number of possible values that the variable can take.
 * Thus, for example, a single bit has two possible values, and an
 * information content of exactly one.
 *
 * The information-theoretic content of a contin variable is log_2(5).
 * This is because there are five ways to alter a contin: twiddle the
 * least-significant pseudo-bit (2 choices: L,R), erase the least
 * significant bit (1 choice), add a new least-significant bit
 * (2 choices: L,R).
 *
 * This routine sums the total information content in a field set,
 * including that in contin and term fields, as well as the discrete
 * and boolean fields.
 *
 * This is usually a good estimate for the total number of nearest
 * neighbors of an instance, rarely differing by more than twenty
 * percent. This is because the nearest neighbors of an instance are
 * those that differ by a Hamming distance of one, and the total
 * length of the instance is approximately equal to info-theo-bits!
