/**
 * Star-shaped search: Apply a modified smulated annealing-style search.
 * Deprecated; its not really simulated annealing, but something else,
 * and this really doesn't work very well. Its here for backward
 * compatibility, for the moment.
 *
 * The search pattern used is similar to the -L1 -T1 -I0 variant of
 * hill-climbing, except that, instead of always searching the nearest
 * neighbors, it occasionally broadens the search to a larger
 * neighborhood, looking at more distant neighbors (thus the name "star
 * shape", as the common term for such non-convex sets in mathematics).
 * The fraction of more distant neighbors explored is determined by a
 * temperature parameter, thus the allusion to annealing. In addition,
 * the same temperature is also used to keep eithr the new best instance,
 * or the old one.  Why these two different, unrelated things should ever
 * have the same temperature is one of the reasons the implementation
 * below is broken/deprecated.
 *
 * A "true" simulated-annealing algo would have worked like this:
 * a) Explore the nearest-neighborhood of a "center instance".
 * b) Using a Boltzmann distribution, select either the highest scroring
 *    instance, or one of the next-best few, as the new center instance.
 * c) Goto step a).
 * but that's NOT AT ALL what this algo does.
