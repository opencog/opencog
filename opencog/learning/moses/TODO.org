* MOSES
** Code Improvements
- [ ] refactore AntFitnessFunction moses/ant_scoring.h so that it uses
  eval in combo/eval.h
- [ ] replace instance_t by vector<bool> (which should automatically pack everything)
- [ ] make a Python binding for MOSES
- [ ] fixed moses_exec so that it returns the right exit code
- [ ] test option -E2 vs E3 for 11-multiplexer
- [ ] finish integrate ANN (1-pole and 2-pole) in moses-exec and test why it has poor performance
- [ ] comments in build_knobs::sample_logical_perms about n(n-1) and check that it's really correct
- [ ] support contin reduct effort
- [ ] _perm_ratio is set to 0, experiment and add it to the program option
  if that is worth
- [ ] in Distributed MOSES add log to tell that there is no more
  candidate to try but we're waiting for more threads to complete to
  see if can get more
- [ ] add remaining evals in distributed moses in the log
- [ ] added log for start "init metapop" and correct "start moses" (inside moses-exec I guess)
- [ ] Distributed MOSES, should run an instance everytime a resource is
  free, and not wait for more merges
- [ ] neighborhood_sampling method and other methods filling the deme
  should not assume the size is right and instead should use
  back_inserter(ret)
- [ ] try adaptive reduct effort in moses-exec
- [ ] in moses-exec replace boolean program options by flags (like with-blah or without-blah)
- [ ] refactore test_sample_from_neighborhood in NeighborSamplingUTest
- [ ] there are possibly confusions btw eda::field_set::arity_t and
  combo::arity_t,
- [ ] there is a big mess between score_t fitness_t and contin_t, fix
  that mess
- [ ] refactore Pedrag slice moses code, optimization API should be
  simple and sliced for everyone

** Ideas (things that should require thought before deciding whether to implement or not)
- [ ] use a normalized variable instead of the variable itself in
  continuous MOSES. For instance #1 becomes (#1 - mean)/std where mean
  and std are the mean and the standard deviation of #1 respectively
- [ ] replace the complexity function by a decent theoretical bit
  length of program
- [ ] add affine adjustment for contin regression
- [ ] add SVM regression to learn bscore to deme mapping
- [ ] blend exemplars with good behavioral score on different ranges
  to increase behavioral score on the whole range
- [ ] see if fitness expectation maximization is good for MOSES
- [ ] use famous continuous regression when the knobs are continuous
- [ ] implement HC EDA
- [ ] add the prob of being wrong in the computation of the conditional entropy (if that makes sense)
