;; Let be a binary predicate P. The pattern we want to discover is
;;
;; P(Inheritance(X, Y))
;;
;; starting from the abstraction
;;
;; P(X)
;;
;; Given a number of instances of P
;;
;; That is, in atomese, the representation of the abstraction is
;;
;; Lambda
;;   Variable "$X"
;;   Evaluation
;;     Predicate "P"
;;     Variable "$X"
;;
;; and the representation of the specialization is
;;
;; Lambda
;;   VariableList
;;     Variable "$X"
;;     Variable "$Y"
;;   Evaluation
;;     Predicate "P"
;;     Inheritance
;;       Variable "$X"
;;       Variable "$Y"
;;
;; For that we build the backward chainer query
;;
;; Compose
;;   Lambda
;;     Variable "$X"
;;     Evaluation
;;       Predicate "P"
;;       Variable "$X"
;;   Variable "$X-specialization"
;;
;; where "$X-specialization" is the pattern that, once composed with
;; the abstraction, will produce our desired specialization.
;;
;; The final answer we're after is
;;
;; Compose
;;   Lambda
;;     Variable "$X"
;;     Evaluation
