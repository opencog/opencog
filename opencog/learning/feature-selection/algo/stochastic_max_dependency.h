/**
 * It looks like this algo resemble a stochastic version of the
 * algorithm coded in the Section 2.1 of the paper entitled "Feature
 * selection based on mutual information: criteria of max-dependency,
 * max-relevance, and min-redundancy." They call it "max-dependency",
 * so I'm calling this algorithm stochastic_max_dependency.
 *
 * Returns a set S of features following the algo:
 * 0) set<FeatureSet> tops = empty set
 * 1) For each FeatureSet fs in tops:
 * 2)     Add one feature, compute new score. Repeat 1)
 * 3) Discard all but top_size of highest scorers
 * 4) tops = the highest scorers.
 * 5) If score hasn't improved by threshold,
 *    then skip next step.
 * 6) Repeat, until tops holds FeatureSets of at most 
 *    'num_features' features.
 * 7) return highest scorer from tops.
 *
 * @param features       The initial set of features to be selected from
 * @param scorer         The function to score a set of features.
 * @param num_features   The maximum number of features to return.
 * @param threshold      Minimum desired improvement in mutual
 *                       information from each addition of a feature
 *                       to the feature set.  If improvement is not seen
 *                       then search is halted.
 * @param top_size       Number of top-correlated feature sets to explore.
 *
 * @return               The set of selected features
