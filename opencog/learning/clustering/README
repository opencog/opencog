                      ----------

This directory is going to contain some relatively simple, quick-n-dirty
clustering algorithms for extracting the number of clusters, and their
sizes, given only a collection of objects, and the pair-wise similarity
between them.  Currently, the primary consumer of this code is planned
to be MOSES; the clustering is neede to get a sensation of the diversity
of the demes being trained in MOSES.  That is, given a collection of
combo trees, and some similarity value between them, the goal is to see
how many of these are similar, and how many are different, and what the
variation within a cluster might be.

Note: in what follows, the similarity mesure is NOT assumed to be a 
"metric" or "distance".  That is, the actual pair-wise similarity
between two objects might not obey the triangle inequality, which is
required for a true distance metric.  This is important, because many
textbook clustering algorithms assume that the similarity measure is in
fact a metric; thus, this requirement rules out most of these.  Another
requirement seems to be that linear clusterers should be avoided, mostly
because its not at all clear that it will be possible to cluster the
data with linear hyperplanes.  (On the other hand, the data is fairly
high-dimensional, so linear sepratation might not actually be
inaccurate.  But we don't know that yet, so lets not assume it.)

Due to the above requirements, the number of suitable clustering
algorithms shrinks to a very sall set; basically, only "spectral
clustering" appears to be appropriate.  Unfortunately, there does not
seem to be any C/C++ open-source available for spectral clustering.
Thus, we take a stab at it here.  Again, this is not, at this time,
meant to be all things to all people; rather, its to be a quick hack.
We'll see how it comes out ...

Algorithm selection:
--------------------
Most algorithms seem to assume spatial data: i.e. true distance measures
(metrics, e.g. Euclidean space).  We do not have that. This includes the 
DBSCAN, OPTICS and BIRCH algorithms, as well as k-means.

 * The DBSCAN and OPTICS algorithms seem to work well only for low-
   dimensional data. (??) We don't have that.

 * BIRCH is disigned for huge datasets. We don't have that much data.

 * EM (expectation maximization) might work; I sort-of a-priori expect
   the clusters to be Gaussian, but I don't really know that yet...

 * k-means tends to produce clusters of similar size. its not clear that
   this will be the case here. Anyway, we don't have a space w/ metric...

By elimination, this leaves some version of spectral clustering as the
only choice.


Spectral Clustering
-------------------
Background reading:

Open-source code: C/C++:

  Appears to be excessively simplistic... not trustworthy.

  Parallel, for supercomp[uters. Overkill.

  WTF? doesn't seem to actually implement spectral clustering???
  I can't find the code its all OpenGL and misc junk ...

OK, so have to hand-build the algo. Oh well.


The Eigenvalue problem
----------------------
What's the best way to solve the eigenvalue problem?  Brute-forcing
this by calling directly into BLAS, ATLAS or LAPACK seems like overhill.
So don't. Seems that the LOBPCG algo is the best.  The LOBPCG inventors
have a standard implementation: BLOPEX.

Because it is not a part of Ubuntu or RedHat, and because its build
system is icky, a copy of BLOPEX is checked in here (in a subdirectory).


The spectral algorithm
----------------------
By default, spectral clustering can only split a dataset into two.
Heirarchical clustering then can split it into more. But whwere to stop?
