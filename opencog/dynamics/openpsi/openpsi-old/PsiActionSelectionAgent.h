/**
 * @class
 *
 * @brief Action Selection Agent
 *
 * Ideally using PLN, looking for, or inferring cognitive schematics and choosing
 * the one according to their weights (calculating the weight can depend on the
 * Modulator Certainty).
 *
 * Each Rule here means a cognitive schematic, that is
 *     Contex & Procedure ==> Goal
 *
 * Rules here has nothing to do with that in PLN, so don't confuse them!
 *
 * An OpenPsi Rule is represented in AtomSpace as below:
 *
 * Note: AtTimeLink is missing currently
 *       ImplicationLink is used instead of PredictiveImplicationLink, since
 *       PLN doesn't support it while implementation
 *
 *     PredictiveImplicationLink
 *         AndLink
 *             AndLink
 *                 EvaluationLink
 *                     GroundedPredicateNode "precondition_1_name"
 *                     ListLink
 *                         Node:arguments
 *                         ...
 *                 EvaluationLink
 *                     PredicateNode         "precondition_2_name"
 *                     ListLink
 *                         Node:arguments
 *                         ...
 *                 ...
 *
 *             ExecutionLink
 *                 GroundedSchemaNode "schema_name"
 *                 ListLink
 *                     Node:arguments
 *                     ...
 *
 *         EvaluationLink
 *             (SimpleTruthValue indicates how well the demand is satisfied)
 *             (ShortTermInportance indicates the urgency of the demand)
 *             PredicateNode: "goal_name"
 *             ListLink
 *                 Node:arguments
 *                 ...
 *
 * For each Rule, there's only a Goal, an Action and a bunch of Preconditions.
 * And all these Preconditions should be grouped in an AndLink.
 * If you want to use OrLink, then just split the Rule into several Rules.
 * For the efficiency and simplicity of the planner (backward chaining),
 * NotLink is forbidden currently.
