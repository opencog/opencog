  Goal are defined as demands choosen for either increase or decrease in

  constraint.

  The GroundedPredicateNode passed should tag the demands for increase or
  decrease by evaluating the demands that satisfy the conditions set through
  its goal-selection function. The function should tag the goal representing
  atom (the demand-ConceptNode) for being increased or decreased.

  gpn:
    - GroundedPredicateNode that names an goal-selection function that will
      choose the demands . Its function should take a single demand-ConceptNode
