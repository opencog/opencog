Needs -std=c++14 flag set. Currently place holder for Atom in int

made pull request for the required Time space Atom Maps with API and example code.
 A little problem due to map being accessed probabilistic-ally is that deletion acts probabilistic as well.
 currently put a hack to change node value for full delete in case all atom references for particular atom need to be forgotten.
 The aHandle type(currently int but will be changed) is supposed to hold atom reference.
 RemoveAtomAtTime removes probabilistic while RemoveAtom to forget all atoms removes by changing value to UndefinedHandle
