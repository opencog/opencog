/**
 * This class implements a base server class that provides basic functionality
 * for third parties who might wish to use their custom server.
 * There are only two primitives provided by this class: an atomspace instance
 * and a factory method.
 *
 * Applications extending the BaseServer must ensure that:
 *      1. the derived server overrides the factory method 'createInstance'
 *      2. the first call to the 'opencog::server()' global function explicitly
 *         passes the derived server's factory method as parameter.
 *
 * See the files CogServerMain.cc, CogServer.h and CogServer.cc for examples.

// Singleton instance (following meyer's design pattern) NOTE: There are
// problems with the way this is being used, in some cases, as it is confusing
// that there are examples of both stack based and factory function singleton
// server creation in the tests and examples. For example, I saw some code
// that did this:
//
// 	  void testAddPunishmentPredicate() {
//        server(SpaceTimeCogServer::createInstance);  << creates one instance
//        SpaceTimeCogServer srv;                      << creates another
//        AtomSpace& atomSpace = srv.getAtomSpace();
//
//        ... other code goes here
//     }
//
// This meant that all the calls to server() in the code would be referring
// to a different server instance than the SpaceTimeCogServer on the stack
// since the only place that the singleton instance variable was set was in
// the code for server(BaseServer* (*)() = BaseServer::createInstance).
//
// So I added a call to set_current_server(this) in the constructor for
// BaseServer so you can use stack-based servers and count on the singleton
// reference calls like:
//
//     server().someServerFuntion(); 
//
// operating on the stack-based server. It also generates a runtime error 
// if you call set_current_server(some_server) with a different server when
// one is already set (whether via server() or otherwise), so the developer
// knows there is a problem like the above example, so developers don't create
// more than one server instance like above by accident.
//
// - Curtis Faith <curtis.m.faith@gmail.com>
//
// I dunno, this whole singleton instance idea is whack. What's wrong
// with just doing it right? The number of problems that singleton
// instances create exceeds the number of problems they solve. They
// should be eliminated from the code.
