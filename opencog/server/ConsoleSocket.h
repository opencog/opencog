 *
 * There may be multiple instances of ConsoleSocket to support multiple 
 * simultaneous clients. This is done by creating a separate thread and 
 * dispatching a client socket for each client that connects to the 
 * server socket.
 *
 * We provide a callback method from the IRPCSocket interface: 
 * 'OnRequestCompleted()'. This callback signals the server socket 
 * that request processing has finished (so that the we may 
 * synchronously send the command prompt to the client but process the 
 * request 'asynchronously' on the cogserver's main thread.
 *
 * As required by the Request abstract class, the ConsoleSocket class
 * also implements the IHasMimeType interface, defining its mime-type
 * as 'text/plain'.
