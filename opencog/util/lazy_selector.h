     *
     * That structure is used to represent what element should be returned when

     * 
     * The one-to-many mapping is used because an already chosen element
     * should only have one possible choice to return instead of itself, 
     * but on the other hand several already chosen elements can points to the
     * same alternative. Of course if one of them is chosen and must return
     * a given alternative all element pointing to it must be updated which
     * is why we use a multi_index_container to quickly access either the first
     * or the second element of the pair.
