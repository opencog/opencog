;; Execute step by step inference to prove that a SUMO Organization
;; has at least one member.
;;
;; The reasoning goes as follows
;;
;; 1. An Organization is a Group, Org1-1 is an instance of an
;; Organization, therefore it is an instance of a Group.
;;
;; 2. A Group is a Collection, from 1. Org1-1 is an instance of a
;; Group, therefore it is an instance of a Collection.
;;
;; 3. A Collection has at least one member, since Org1-1 is a
;; Collection it has at least one member.
;;
;; Warning: if each step takes too long start guile loading only
;; Merge.scm instead all-sumo-labeled-kb.scm (don't forget to copy
;; Merge.scm from`<EXTERNAL_TOOLS>/SUMO_importer/sumo/output` to the
;; current directory).
;;
;; guile --no-auto-compile -l Merge.scm
