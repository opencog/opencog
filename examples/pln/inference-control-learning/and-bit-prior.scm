;;    This prior is important because otherwise instances of and-BIT
;;    not being found as preproof will have a null confidence, that is
;;    because we cannot know with certainty that an and-BIT is *not* a
;;    preproof as it may require to explore the entire univers of
;;    proofs to rule it out. But a null confidence would count as
;;    nothing (according to an extension of the formula in Section
;;    2.4.1.1 of the PLN book to consider uncertainty) which would
;;    make it hard to compare the performances of two predictors since
;;    if they have only positive examples, then the one with the
;;    higher number of examples would win, even if it less accurate,
;;    which isn't right. Indeed the reason is because not finding a
;;    proof does actually bring a bit of information, since there are
;;    so many more non-proofs that proofs, a random and-BIT is likely
;;    not a preproof. That is what this prior captures.
