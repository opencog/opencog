# Conceptual Blending Examples
* Examples using the Conceptual Blending API.

## Files
* 1_blend_simple.py: Simple example to use blend API.
* 2_blend_with_config.py: Request to blend API with custom config.
  * Atoms that have STI value above 12 will be considered to blend.
  * Force to start blend, and choose 2 nodes randomly.
* 3_blend_with_conflict_links.py: Simple example describes conflict input case.
  * Force to start blend, and choose 2 nodes have highest STI value.
  * Make 2^k available(viable) new blend atoms if there exists k conflicts,
    * If two similarity links strength value have difference above 0.3 and 
      confidence value both bave above 0.7, blender thinks they conflict to 
      each other.
