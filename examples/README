This directory contains various examples that use the OpenCog framework.

guile           - Guile (scheme) usage examples
python          - Python usage examples

pattern-matcher - Provides example scheme code that defines a search
                  pattern (using BindLink).
atomtypes       - Shows how to define custom atom types.
hopfield        - Provides a toy example for Economic Attention
                  Allocation Networks, using OpenCog to emulate a
                  associate memory neural network known as a
                  'Hopfield network'.
visual_demos    - A number of demos to visually represent the dynamics
                  of OpenCog.

Deprecated examples:
--------------------
The strategic direction for opencog is to move away from the current
cogserver + modules + agents design, and to encourage coding entirely
in either scheme and python.   Thus, please reconsider creating new
agents using these deprecated C++ interfaces.

module          - Provides a template for creating a custom module.
agents          - Provides a template for creating a custom agent.
