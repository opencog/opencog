                             Example Module
                            ---------------

In OpenCog, a "Module" is a dynamically loadable module: a wrapper for
some code that can be loaded into the CogServer after it has been
started.  The point of using a module is that it makes compiling and
debugging code easier, since, after a change, only the module needs to
be rebuilt, and not the entire cogserver.

This directory provides an example of a very basic module.

To test this module, do the following:

*) Start the cogserver: From a shell prompt, issue the command
   ./opencog/server/cogserver from the build directory

*) Connect to the server: telnet localhost 17001

*) Load the module: at the cogserver prompt, issue the command:
   opencog> loadmodule examples/module/libexample_module.so
   You should see 'done' printed on a line by itself.

*) Verify that it has been loaded: at the cogserver prompt, issue the
   command 'listmodules'. The module will be called 
   opencog::ExampleModule, and so you should see:
   Filename: libexample_module.so, ID: opencog::ExampleModule

*) Unload the module: 
   opencog> unloadmodule opencog::ExampleModule

That's all folks!  The rest is up to you!
