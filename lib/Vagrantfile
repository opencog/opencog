  To ssh into the virtual machine run 'vagrant ssh'.

  The virtual machine has all the dependencies required for working on
  cogutil, atomspace, moses, and opencog.

  octool can be found at '/tmp/octool'.

  The folder from which your run 'vagrant up' is accessiable at
  '/home/vagrant/opencog' on sshing into the virtual machine.

  Virtual machine ports 5000 and 17001 are mapped to ports 5000 and 17001
  on your host machine.

  Have fun :-)
