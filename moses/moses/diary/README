    Research Diary, Raw Data, Semi-Digested Notes, Graphs, Figures.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

Subdirectories contain assorted notes and data used to make coding
and design decisions.  These are raw notes and data.  They are not going
to be explained in any sort of greater detail than what can already be
found within them.  They are meant to be a record of the research, so as
to assist future verification or regression testing, etc.

-- directory complexity-temperature:
   Graphs for understanding/changing the way select_exemplar() works,
   circa January/February 2012, bzr revisions 6530-6580 or so.
   See ../documentation/Select_Exemplar.html for the formal write-up of
   these results.

-- directory genetic-crossover:
   Graphs for exploring optimistic extrapolation in a modified
   nearest-neighbor search.  Details changes in the bzr rev 6620-6683
   or thereabouts. Circa Feb/March 2012.  Research results documented in 
   ../documentation/Genetic Crossover.html

-- directory diversity:
   Experiments with guarenteeing diversity of exploration.

-- directory scaling-mpi:
   Exploring scaling of the MOSES algorithm as a function of the number
   of MPI nodes in a compute cluster.
