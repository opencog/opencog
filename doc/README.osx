Instructions for Apple Mac OSX users
------------------------------------

The MacPorts installer does not include /opt/local/lib into the shared
library search path. Thus, any libraries installed there will fail to
be found.  The search path needs to be fixed manually.  This can be done 
by editing ~/.profile and specifying

  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

A dynamic library search path failure will manifest itself with this
error message:

    ./opencog/server/cogserver
    Searching for config in default locations...
    Found ../lib/opencog.conf
    loaded configuration from file "../lib/opencog.conf"
    File: ../opencog/scm/utilities.scm line: 9
    ERROR: In procedure dynamic-link:
    ERROR: file: "libguile-srfi-srfi-1-v-3", message: "file not found"
    ABORT: misc-error

Proper operation can be confirmed with opencog, or by invoking guile on
the command line:

    $ guile
    guile> (use-modules (srfi srfi-1))
    guile>

The above should not generate any errors when the shared libary load
path is correctly configured.
