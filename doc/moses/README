********
Overview
********

Meta-optimizing semantic evolutionary search (MOSES) is a new approach
to program evolution, based on representation-building and probabilistic
modeling. MOSES has been successfully applied to solve hard problems in
domains such as computational biology, sentiment evaluation, and agent
control. Results tend to be more accurate, and require less objective
function evaluations, in comparison to other program evolution systems.
Best of all, the result of running MOSES is not a large nested structure
or numerical vector, but a compact and comprehensible program written in
a simple Lisp-like mini-language. For more information see
http://metacog.org/doc.html .


**********************
Code and Documentation
**********************

The code for reproducing all of the published experiments on MOSES 
may be found in the learning/moses subdirectory.

Below is a list of publications on MOSES.  The QuickGuide.pdf file in
this driectory provides an overview of the MOSES alorithms and the main
structures and routines in the source code.  In addition, documentation
may be found here:

learning/moses/man   -- a unix 'manual' page describing the executable.
learning/moses/documentation  -- algorthm insights
learning/moses/diary  -- a diary of experimental results


************
Installation
************

You need to have a recent gcc (4.5 or newer), the boost libraries 
(version 1.44 or newer, http://www.boost.org) and the CMake package
(http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Index.html).

Create a directory called "build" in the root folder, then cd to it.
Run "cmake .." in this directory.  This will create the needed
makefiles. Then, make the project using "make" (from the build
directory).

Generated executables will be in the folder build/learning/moses/main.
