OpenCog is a framework for developing AI systems, especially appropriate for
integrative multi-algorithm systems, and artificial general intelligence
systems. Though much work remains to be done, it currently contains a
functional core framework, and a number of cognitive agents at varying levels
of completion, some already displaying interesting and useful functionalities
alone and in combination.

The main project site is at <a href="http://opencog.org/">opencog.org</a>.
